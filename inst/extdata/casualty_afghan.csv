å¦   Family members said he loved to play the piano and trombone. He was taught to read by age 3, and later preached and recited Scripture from a stump in his back yard.
å¦   He was full of energy and always smiling. ""Even though he had a short life, he had a full life,"" said the Rev. Jim Parsley, who officiated at a memorial service.
å¦   Hughie is survived by his wife, Alexis, his 3-month-old son, Cooper.

CEFCOM NR‰ÛÒ07.031 - August 7, 2007

OTTAWA ‰ÛÒ Rob Costall was a true Canadian son who valued life and lived it to the fullest with everything our beautiful country could offer him.  He was the type of person who would hold a door open for a complete stranger, with a smile and a hello.

He should be remembered for holding the door of hope open to the people of Afghanistan.

Remembered not for how he died but rather for what he lived for.  Being Canadian, proud, strong and free.

","From the Town of Gatineau, Gunner Jonathan Dion joined the Canadian Forces January 21st, 2005. Proud gunner, Jonathan was a member of 5 RÌ©giment d‰Ûªartillerie lÌ©gÌ¬re du Canada, based in Valcartier, Qc. Jonathan was 27 years old and he was on his first NATO mission.

GATINEAU, Qc - The family of private Jonathan Dion killed in service in Afghanistan on December the 30th 2007, wishes to make public the following declaration:

It is never easy for parents to lose a child. We are devastated by the death of Jonathan who, with dignity, gave up his life serving his country with honour and pride alongside his brothers in arms in Afghanistan. We are extremely proud of our son and of what he accomplished during his life including his career in the Canadian Armed Forces. It will be his distinctive smile and his joie de vivre which will remain in our minds as we think of him. He loved being a soldier and loved being in the company of brothers and sisters in arms.

Jonathan had found his rightful place in the Canadian Forces. He was maturing rapidly and showed that he was living life to the fullest and was developing his full potential. He was an example to all of his family and he was a great brother. Since he passionately believed in his mission in Afghanistan we supported him when he volunteered for this mission. Quite recently he was telling us he would like to return should there be a second tour.

Jonathan lived the major part of his life in the city of Gatineau. He loved his city, his small part of the country, and his neighbourhood. He wanted more than anything else to make a difference in the world around him. He died doing what he loved best, to be a soldier and serve his country.

After passing out of recruit training, 'Dee' joined 42 Commando Royal Marines where he took part in numerous deployments around the world as well as taking part in OP PALLISER and OP SILKMAN in Sierra Leone and OP BANNER in Northern Ireland.

'Dee' was a giant of a man who impressed all who met him. Ever cheerful, he would never allow problems to get him down. He always had a friendly word for anyone he met and his fantastic personality filled any room he walked into. He was an excellent listener and would always make time for others.

'Dee' loved his boxing and rugby and represented the Royal Marines at rugby union. He was also a keen water polo player and represented the Royal Navy and the Combined Services team at the sport.

Humorous, caring and a true friend, he will be sadly missed by all his comrades in 40 Commando Royal Marines and the wider Corps family. 

'Dee' leaves behind a loving fiancÌ©e and family of whom he talked about to anybody and everybody.

BC-A Marine's Death
AP Exclusive: Corps investigation finds Marine who died at Africa base wasn't hazed or abused
å¦   SEATTLE (AP) _ A Marine was not being hazed or abused when he collapsed and died on a base in Africa, but his superiors broke rules when they had him exercise as punishment for slightly injuring another Marine, a commander concluded.
å¦   Lance Cpl. Dustin Canham chose to do push-ups and other exercises to avoid having a black mark on his record and his death March 23 was due solely to a heart condition, said Lt. Gen. Samuel T. Helland, commander of U.S. Marine Corps Forces Central Command, in a summary provided to Canham's father.
å¦   The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is investigating Canham's death separately, but the Marine report includes some statements other Marines made to NCIS.
å¦   Canham, 21, of Lake Stevens, Wash., and a Marine private had been playing catch with a rock that day at the U.S. base in Djibouti, according to the documents. The private told investigators he looked away just before Canham threw the rock, which hit him in the mouth. It chipped his tooth, but the injury did not require medical attention.
å¦   Platoon Sgt. Jesus Diaz, 24, of Bakersfield, Calif., informed a staff sergeant, who noted that putting the incident in Canham's record could hinder his promotion.
å¦   The staff sergeant recommended that Diaz give Canham a choice of receiving a mark on his record or performing physical training, and Canham chose the latter.
å¦   ""(The staff sergeant) and I both felt LCpl Canham was a good Marine, and did not want to have to write him up for this incident,"" Diaz told an NCIS investigator in a signed statement.
å¦   The names of witnesses were redacted in the file, but The Associated Press independently identified Diaz and the other superior who brought Canham into the tent, Cpl. Richard Abril, 28.
å¦   With Diaz watching, Abril and Canham exercised together in a ""daily seven"" routine of 30 push-ups followed by leg lifts and other core-body work. Only three minutes after they started, Canham ""stopped, went to his knees, sat back on his hips, leaned up against a rack and passed out,"" Abril wrote in a statement to investigators.
å¦   Diaz ran for help as Abril performed CPR until emergency responders arrived, they wrote. But he could not be revived. An autopsy found a mildly enlarged heart with a thickening of the left ventricular wall, which left Canham vulnerable to cardiac arrest.
å¦   The investigative file makes clear that the use of physical training was not authorized. ""Extra military instruction"" _ the assignment of extra tasks _ may be given to correct a Marine's shortcomings, but not as punishment, Helland wrote.
å¦   However, he wrote, the training was neither harsh nor abusive and was not the cause of death.
å¦   In letters shortly after Canham died, the Marines told his family he collapsed while exercising, but the letters didn't explain why he was inside the tent with two superiors. Canham's father, Mark, and widow, Devyn, suspected he might have been hazed or forced to work out until he died.
å¦   Mark Canham said he wants to see for himself if Diaz told the truth to investigators.
å¦   ""If he could tell me to my face what happened in that tent, then I'd believe it,"" he said.",3/26/08 15:32,8/28/09 10:025258,Storgaard ,Anders Bjoern ,,Pvt. ,Dead,U,21,Taastrup,Denmark,Other,Other,Army,,,,Denmark,,3/26/08 0:00,3/26/08 0:00,Action,"Helmand province, Afghanistan","COPENHAGEN (AP)--Denmark's military says a Danish soldier has been killed in Afghanistan.

","Private Charles David Murray, 'Dave' to his friends and colleagues, was serving as a rifleman and Assault Engineer with 4 Platoon, B Company, 2 PARA when he was killed in action by a suicide device in Helmand Province, southern Afghanistan. 

Private Murray, 19, was born in Dumfries on 7 January 1989, but grew up in Carlisle. He began his military career early. Having left school at the age of 16 he attended the Army Foundation College in Harrogate in September 2005, where his passion and skill for rugby league saw him represent the college during a tour to Australia. 

His slight stature belied a standard of fitness and robustness that set the standard in his platoon. His love of soldiering, and admiration for his Section Commander, led him to choose a career in The Parachute Regiment. 

Having successfully completed his initial training he attended the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick, North Yorkshire. It was here that he completed his training, passing the physically demanding Pre- Parachute Selection Course, P Company, as the champion recruit. He became eligible to serve with The Parachute Regiment and subsequently earned his military parachute wings at RAF Brize Norton.

He joined the 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment in December 2006 as his platoon was preparing to be held on standby for High Readiness tasks within 16 Air Assault Brigade. He quickly fitted in due to his naturally relaxed and outgoing nature. It did not take long for him to demonstrate his soldiering ability and he undertook specialist training as an Infantry Assault Engineer within a year of joining the battalion, a course usually reserved for soldiers of greater experience. 

Private Murray had come into his own during the first two months of the battalion's tour of duty in Afghanistan. Always putting his team-mates and colleagues first, his technical competency and professionalism shone brightly in Afghanistan. He worked tirelessly despite soaring temperatures and was totally committed to his job. It is often said and never truer, he was a rising star, and a future leader.

Private Gamble deployed to Afghanistan in March 2008.  Employed as the platoon linguist, he had gone forward with typical enthusiasm and professionalism to speak with a local Afghani when his platoon was attacked. 

Private Gamble, 22, was born on 25 June 1985 and grew up in Uckfield, East Sussex. After a short period working in a variety of jobs upon leaving school, he applied to join The Parachute Regiment and completed his basic training at the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick, North Yorkshire. 

It was during this time that he passed the demanding Pre-Parachute Selection Course, known as 'P Company', and became eligible to serve with The Parachute Regiment. He joined 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment in October 2006 having earned his parachute 'wings' at RAF Brize Norton. 

Upon arriving at 2 PARA, he joined 4 Platoon B Company and instantly made an impression. Bright and determined, he showed true grit during the battalion's High Readiness exercises and marked himself as a man with the potential to go further.

It was during the initial phases of planning for the deployment to Afghanistan that Private Gamble was tested to assess his aptitude to learn a foreign language. Out of the 150 Private soldiers that were tested, he was one of 10 soldiers who showed the best aptitude to learn the language of the Afghan locals, Pashto.  

Bright, determined and always positive, he completed the 40-week full-time language course, motivated by his eagerness to get out to Afghanistan and make a difference. His positive approach, friendship and humour helped the others on the course to stay focussed and upbeat. 

He was confident too, willingly standing up in front of 300 soldiers and delivering a presentation on Pashto culture as part of pre-deployment training. His ability to speak the language of the locals of Helmand Province made a remarkable difference in the two months he spent in Afghanistan. 

His skill and charisma ensured that he was always at the forefront of any patrol, his enthusiasm for his chosen profession was both relentless and infectious.

Private Cuthbertson, aged 19, was born in Sunderland on 5 January 1989. He began his military career aged just 16. Having left school he chose not to wait until he was old enough for adult service and attended the Army Foundation College in Harrogate in October 2005. Whilst at the Army Foundation College he stood out as a soldier and chose to join The Parachute Regiment. Upon completing his initial training he moved on to the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick where he completed his basic training and passed the physically demanding Pre-Parachute Selection, P Company.

Once he had earned his military parachute wings he joined 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment in December 2006. With typical energy and drive he quickly embraced the spirit of the Regiment and in under a year had undertaken and passed the technically challenging Infantry Assault Engineers course, usually reserved for more experienced soldiers. 

During pre-deployment training and deployment to Afghanistan he again excelled operating the platoon's specialist weapon, the general purpose machine gun. He handled the responsibility with characteristic aplomb and was hugely proud to be the section gunner. 
Rarely seen without a smile, he could be depended upon to cheer up the platoon, even in the most adverse conditions from the Northumberland rain of pre-deployment training to the heat of the Afghan summer.

He grew up in Plymouth and joined the Royal Marines on 5 July 2004. 

His selfless and helpful attitude singled him out for praise throughout the rigours of Commando training. He served with 45 Commando Royal Marines as a rifleman in Zulu Company, during which time he deployed on combat operations in Afghanistan on Op Herrick 5. Zulu Company was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of that deployment, predominantly operating in the southern region of Helmand province. 

On his return to the UK he was selected for specialist training and joined the Signals Branch of the Royal Marines. He was noted for his strong performance on the communicators' course and qualified as a Royal Marines Communicator, Class 3, in July 2007. He subsequently joined 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines and served with 3 Commando Brigade's light amphibious raiding unit until April 2008. 

A confident soldier, he deployed to Afghanistan on Op Herrick 9 looking forward to proving himself in the challenging role of mentoring the Afghan National Police with his comrades in the Security Sector Reform Group; an aspiration which he rapidly and convincingly fulfilled. Already a veteran of this operational theatre in spite of his youth, he was always keen to impart his hard-won knowledge to those less experienced. 

He had great ambition, and huge potential; his infectious sense of humour and abundance of natural leadership made him an instant hit with the Afghan Security Forces that he mentored and fought alongside.

Marine Mackin's family have strong links with the military and one of his brothers is serving with 1st Battalion The Rifles, also deployed in Helmand on Op Herrick 9. The loss of such an incredibly popular and exceptionally loyal member of our band of brothers is a tragedy. The tributes below say it all. Our thoughts are with his family at this sad and tragic time.

He joined the Royal Marines in October 1996 and specialised in the mortars heavy weapons branch very early on in his career. Serving with both 40 Commando and 45 Commando he had served operationally in Northern Ireland and in Iraq on Operation Telic in 2003 where he was involved in the initial aviation assault of southern Iraq. 

After returning from Operation Herrick in Afghanistan in 2007 he completed command training and his enthusiasm to deploy to Helmand for a second time was testament to his determined attitude. Corporal Winter was an extremely professional and dedicated member of the Unit Mortar Troop and he epitomised its unique ethos. He had a true passion for his specialisation and revelled in the small community of which he became a vital part. 

Highly capable and determined, Cpl Winter was also exceptionally laid back and humble. He undertook everything with absolute gusto, whether it was at work, supporting his beloved Manchester United FC, or spending time with his family and partner Amanda, with whom he shared his life. His enthusiasm was infectious as was his smile, which always had a laugh not far behind it. His combination of attributes made him an irreplaceable character to be around. Unselfish and unswervingly loyal to all that knew him, he encompassed all of the qualities of a Royal Marine.

He enlisted into the Army on 18 December 2003, attending the Army Foundation College in Harrogate in 2004 and completing his Combat Infantryman's course at the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick in January 2005 where he was posted to 'C' Company, 1st Battalion The Devonshire and Dorset Regiment. He served with C Company as a Private in Iraq from April to November 2006.

He completed his Potential Junior Non-Commissioned Officer Cadre in early 2007. He was promoted to Lance Corporal in November 2007 and posted to the Reconnaissance Platoon of 'S' Company, 1st Battalion The Rifles (1 RIFLES). He soon completed the arduous Sniper course during the battalion's jungle training exercise to Belize, Central America, in the early part of 2008.

Corporal Robinson joined 'E' Company, 1 RIFLES, in April 2008 as a Sniper, Mentor, and Section Second-in-Command. Having completed the pre-deployment training that summer, he deployed with E Company to Sangin in Helmand province, Afghanistan, on Op Herrick 9 at the end of September. 

Corporal Robinson was a key team player in an operating environment where the individual skills of each and every member of the team have a decisive effect on the outcome of every situation. With his reconnaissance and sniper skills, and his sense of professional pride, he provided those decisive effects, and did so with sensibility, determination, and a ready sense of humour. He was quiet and conscientious, keeping his eye on the detail and getting on with his daily tasks efficiently and without great fuss or search for recognition.


""He was a popular, talented man and will be badly missed. Highly qualified and richly experienced for one of his vintage, he was credible and confident as an Acting Corporal and was already showing potential well beyond that."" 
Lieutenant Colonel Joe Cavanagh, Commanding Officer, 1 RIFLES 
As a mentor to the Afghan National Army, he brought all his professional experience to bear in a working environment where he was required to operate two ranks higher than his current rank. He received the acting rank of full Corporal for this tour, in recognition of the extra responsibilities and pressures of working at the Afghan Company level of operations in the isolated and austere environment of the deployed Afghan Patrol Bases. 

He took all this in his stride, dealing with each challenge as it came and ensuring that all his own Riflemen were prepared and administered for the myriad of often unpredictable tasks that the Operational Mentoring mission entailed. 

His loss to the small and tight knit team of which he was an integral part will be felt heavily, but it is his family and friends, both inside and outside the regiment who will mourn his tragic passing; our thoughts are with his brother Matthew, serving in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, sister Sophie, and his father Kenneth and mother Janet.

Educated at Pittville School in Cheltenham, he joined the Army Cadets at the age of 13. On 2 September 1993 he enlisted at the Cheltenham Army Careers Office joining the Gloucestershire Regiment, who later became the Royal Gloucestershire Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment (RGBW). 

Corporal Nield completed a Potential Junior Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Cadre in December 2000 and his Mortar NCO Standard Course in December a year later. Corporal Nield surprised his colleagues by leaving the Army in April 2004 but rejoined in July 2006. 

After the founding of The Rifles he then went on to pass the demanding Forward Air Controllers' Course in April 2007.

Corporal Nield's calm West Country exterior masked the steely professionalism of a true warrior who relished his time spent on operations. Having served on operations in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Kosovo, he had already completed a previous tour of Afghanistan. 


""He was a brave man doing vital work; we are lucky to have known and served with him, and poorer now he has died."" 
Lieutenant Colonel Joe Cavanagh
Corporal Nield had also taken part in exercises with his Regiment across the globe including Arizona, Botswana, Belize, Canada, Cyprus, Kenya and Kuwait. 

Corporal Nield deployed in September 2008 for Operation Herrick 9 as part of a FST where his role was to control fast jets and attack helicopters in direct support of UK and Afghan Forces on the ground. This was his second tour in this role and was clearly a job that he loved.

His experience, dedication and unwavering enthusiasm were an inspiration to all. He consistently provided clear and concise advice to his ground commanders and used his initiative to bring in air support, frequently in circumstances of extreme pressure and danger, to have a decisive effect on the enemy. As such he was largely responsible for the safe return of many of his UK and Afghan colleagues over the tour.

Corporal Nield was a personable, reliable and loyal team member. His sense of humour was legendary across the Regiment and he would seldom miss an opportunity to poke fun at his mates. As an FAC within an artillery-dominated Team, Corporal Nield would often be heard winding up his colleagues with the phrase, ""Guns for show, jets for a pro!"" for which they seldom had a riposte! 

Blessed with a nickname unspeakable in polite company, he would habitually introduce himself as such much to the entertainment of his colleagues. 

Corporal Nield will be sorely missed by all who had the privilege to serve with him from his FST, the Riflemen of S Company OMLT as well as the wider regiment of The Rifles. 

However, it is his parents Peter and Sheila, sisters Emily and Kimberley, and brother Anthony who will feel his loss the greatest and our thoughts and prayers go out to them all as we mourn the passing of a great Rifleman who died living the life that he loved.

Daz was enormously popular with all of the other members of X-ray Company.

During the quieter times of the deployment when relaxed and amongst his mates, Daz would always speak of his two-year-old daughter, Keira, of whom he was immensely proud.

In summer 2006 Lance Corporal Kingscott served in Iraq with 1st Battalion The Devon and Dorset Light Infantry before they were amalgamated into 1st Battalion The Rifles, in which he served in Belize, the Falkland Islands and Afghanistan. 

During pre-deployment training for Operation Herrick 9, he was selected for special language training, passing an intensive ten-week Dari course. 

In Afghanistan he was employed in the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT) Battle Group, working in one of the small, tight-knit teams that train and fight alongside the Afghan National Army. 

Lance Corporal Kingscott was a physically fit individual who enjoyed many sports and represented the battalion in the 1st XI football and cricket teams. When in Afghanistan he could also be found teaching and playing volleyball with the Afghan National Army in the Patrol Base.


""He was a splendid representative of the Battalion and The Rifles. We are all very proud to have served alongside him."" 
Lieutenant Colonel Joe Cavanagh, CO 1 RIFLES
Lance Corporal Kingscott was an intelligent, competent, friendly and popular Rifleman who was dedicated to his work, selflessly placing himself in harm's way before his comrades. He was larger than life and would always be the first to raise the morale of his team when the going was tough in southern Helmand. 

Once, out patrolling in the Green Zone, his balance failed him whilst tiptoeing over a precarious log bridge, sending him tumbling into one of the many irrigation ditches. Right behind him, his Company Commander, Major Andy Watkins, asked after his well-being. 

As a team mate gave him a helping hand out of the water, his reply was simply ""I wanted to try out my backstroke, it's getting a little rusty"", and with a wry smile continued on with the patrol; testimony to his irrepressible sense of humour and cheerfulness in adversity. 

His commitment to those around him was a constant theme noted by his fellow Riflemen, who always found themselves behind Lance Corporal Kingscott when advancing on the enemy.

He was selected as an apprentice for Land Rover before deciding that his future lay in the Armed Forces. 

Soon after turning twenty, he enlisted into the Army in Hereford on 20 November 2007. Whilst waiting to start his basic training he worked long hours to get to the peak of physical fitness. He successfully completed his Combat Infantryman's Course at the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick in May 2008, triumphing over an injury to reach the required standard. 

On passing out from the centre he was posted to E Company, 1st Battalion The Rifles, in Beachley, Gloucestershire. He was twenty-one years old.

As a new Rifleman in the newly formed company, Rifleman Gunn settled in quickly to the hectic pace of pre-deployment training where his previous experience as a Land Rover mechanic was put to good use. 

Practical with his hands and always keen to help, he was an asset to the team in making their life more comfortable when in the rough conditions of exercise and later on operations in Helmand, southern Afghanistan. 

Careful in his choice of friends, he was a loyal and conscientious young man who was enthusiastic about his expectant career. 

Predictably, he came out of his shell once the tour started in earnest, quickly establishing himself as a core member of his team and earning the respect of his commanders and fellow Riflemen alike. 

Humorous, and at the centre of every banter session, he was clearly relishing his chosen profession, taking pride in his work and totally at ease in the harsh and austere working environment of these eight-man teams. 

His valuable work with the soldiers of the Afghan National Army saw them develop noticeably over the months he acted as a mentor.

He was an integral part of a small and tight knit team, forged by common experience and communal struggle. His loss drives a deep sadness into this team and he will be sorely missed by those who will continue the struggle. 

Our pain does not compare to the grief of his parents, Janet and Mervyn, and his sister Jess; our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time.

He was on patrol with his OMLT with whom he had been operating since April 2008.

Paul Upton was born in Paderborn on 17 March 1977. On completion of his Combat Infantryman's Course at the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick he was posted to A Company, 1st Battalion The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, on 24 February 1997. 

He served in the anti-tank platoon with a tour to Northern Ireland and exercises in Canada. Lance Corporal Upton left the Army in 2000 to pursue other interests, although he was deployed as a reservist to Kosovo with the 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. He re-enlisted in December 2007 and was posted to E Company, 1st Battalion The Rifles, in April 2008 in time to commence pre-deployment training for their operational tour in Afghanistan alongside his brother Leon, a serjeant [spelling of 'sergeant' with a 'j' is unique to The Rifles] in C Company of the same battalion. 

Lance Corporal Upton was thirty-one years old. Mature and experienced, he immediately settled back into regimental life. It was as if he had never been away and he clearly relished being back in the battalion environment and back with many of his friends from his former regiment. 

His determined and friendly manner was evident in his energetic approach to all he did, and he took many of the younger Riflemen under his wing, offering advice, but never forcing it, and 'digging out blind' at all tasks. He led by example and encouraged others with boundless enthusiasm and a ready smile. 

He was a clear candidate for the forthcoming Non-Commissioned Officer cadre and had already shown his ability and potential as an Acting Lance Corporal during the tour.

As a mentor to the Afghan National Army, his patience and maturity shone through and he was a vital part of the mentoring effort. 

This tragic loss will be felt sorely by all who knew him in the battalion, and particularly by his team-mates. He was a constant presence and a rock for the team, bearing adversity and hardship with consummate ease and a constantly bright outlook on life, which was a bonus to all who knew him. 

However, we feel most for the sorrow and grief of Paul's parents Peter and Christine, his brother Leon, and his much loved son Jake. Our sense of loss is nothing compared to their grief and we are thinking and praying for them at this time.

He took part in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme and had been a member of the Blackbrook Scout Troop.

He enlisted into the Army in Taunton and, on completion of the Combat Infantryman's Course at the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick, was posted to 2nd Battalion The Light Infantry (2 LI, later to become 3 RIFLES) on 25 November 2002. 

He was promoted to Lance Corporal in 2005 and attended the Section Commanders Battle Course in the summer of 2006. His performance was remarked upon as the 'best of the 2 LI batch'. 

He served on Op TELIC 2 (Iraq) and on peacekeeping operations in Cyprus, joining the 2 LI Recce (Reconnaissance) Platoon where he was 'zealous and enthusiastic' by nature, earning the respect of his peers and becoming one of the most popular members of his platoon.

Corporal Gaden was posted to 1st Battalion The Rifles (1 RIFLES) in February 2008, moving to E Company that April, and was immediately selected to attend the Close Quarters Battle Skills Course with a view to passing on these skills to the company for the tour to Afghanistan. 

However, he was almost immediately selected to deploy as a Section Commander to Umm Qasr, Iraq, as part of the battalion's commitment to that operational theatre. He spent four months working with the Naval Transition Team before redeploying just after Christmas 2008 to rejoin his original team in a remote Forward Operating Base (FOB) in Helmand, southern Afghanistan.

Corporal Gaden was a competent and assuredly professional operator, selected for the technically complex skills of Close Quarters Battle, then selected again to carry out a discrete and independent task for the battalion. 

He took these rapid changes in his stride, remaining resourceful and flexible to the operational requirements and always relishing the challenge. He thrived in Iraq and led his section with skill and determination throughout that short tour. 

On arrival in Afghanistan, he immediately involved himself in the small team environment in an isolated and austere FOB as team third-in-command, stepping up where necessary as second-in-command of the team. 

Corporal Gaden was a Rifleman of the calibre that has shaped the regiment's reputation and the battalion's character and ethos. He was well known for his strong faith and deep sense of duty, which was reflected in his qualities as a commander and friend to those around him. 

He was part of the future of this great organisation and his sacrifice will be felt by all Riflemen. Our sense of loss cannot match the sorrow and grief that is being felt by Corporal Gaden's family, and his fiancÌ©e. Our prayers are with them at this time.

After completing Royal Marines Commando recruit training in September 2006, he joined 45 Commando Royal Marines and immediately deployed with the unit on Operation HERRICK 5 to Afghanistan. 

Returning to the unit in early 2008 after successfully completing his Royal Marines Signals Specialisation course, his dedication, enthusiasm and professionalism ensured that he immediately stood out from his peers. 

The epitome of a Royal Marine, his desire to be right at the heart of Commando unit life manifested itself in his single-minded determination and desire to return to a close combat company. Confident in his abilities, his relentless drive and tenacity and the continual pestering of the Signal Troop Sergeant Major saw him joining Yankee Company in time for operations in the Upper Sangin Valley in Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK 9. 

Marine Laski was a dependable, brave and selfless man.  He loved his job, and was exceptionally good at it. His spirit and tenacity in the face of adversity and danger were unswerving and his sense of humour and love for life was apparent in everything he did. 

He was an exceptional Commando, and he was blessed with a truly engaging personality that endeared him to all. Hugely popular within the company, his natural and infectious sense of humour always meant that he was at the centre of company banter. 

Marine Laski was a ferociously loyal Royal Marine, dedicated to his friends and to the Corps, and that is how he will best be remembered. His loss will be felt deeply by all.

He started in B (Rorke's Drift) Company and soon afterwards deployed with them to Iraq where he did exceptionally well.

He trained as a team medic so that he could look after his mates if they were injured, trained as a Warrior Gunner so that he could defend himself and his colleagues, and later qualified as a signaller so that he could ensure that critical information was passed to headquarters as soon as possible.

Being an intelligent man, LCpl Harkett was always quick to learn, but he was also very dedicated and keen to help. He showed great promise and, earlier than normal, was selected for a promotion cadre in September 2005. He was promoted to Lance Corporal the following January. 

LCpl Harkett then transferred to the elite Reconnaissance Platoon as he was an experienced and very able soldier, and deployed with them on a very demanding and dangerous tour in Iraq in 2007 where, again, he did very well.

He was one of the first to volunteer to deploy with his mates to Afghanistan as a sniper. He had already had a full and successful career and had a very bright future ahead of him, just like his father and grandfather before him. 

LCpl Harkett was very much a son of the regiment and has been known by many as a boy and now as a man. His grandfather joined the 2nd Battalion South Wales Borderers in 1946 and earned a commendation on operations in Malaya; and his father joined The Royal Regiment of Wales in 1984 and had an excellent career over 26 years reaching Warrant Officer Class 1.

LCpl Harkett was born only two years after his father joined the regiment in 1986 and has grown up with many of today's soldiers or their children. He was always at the centre of the fun and was always liked by those who met him.

He was a keen and active boy gaining all sorts of awards for outdoor pursuits and playing football in a local league. It was natural for him to join his father's regiment as soon as he could which is what he did as a boy soldier in December 2002.

After passing out of training, he was posted to 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards, where he served as an Electronics Technician in A Squadron's Fitter Section. He was on his first operational tour when his life was so tragically cut short. 

Graeme 'Stiffy' Stiff excelled in his field. He greatly looked forward to deploying to Afghanistan and quickly proved to be a most reliable driver and craftsman in the demanding environment of southern Helmand. He was a hardworking and happy individual who loved his job and the friendships and camaraderie of his team. He revelled in his Corps' motto of 'Arte et Marte' ('By Skill and by Fighting') and was always found tinkering with his Jackal and ensuring that it was ready for action. 

He was a shining example of a REME craftsman, working hard and playing hard, and adding every minute to the morale and happiness of the Squadron. He was exceptionally adaptable and in great demand for his expertise, often volunteering to go out on patrol even when exhausted; yet he was still able to improve the morale of those around him. 

'Stiffy' was a keen sportsman and a particularly skilful footballer who represented both the REME and QDG at Football. He also enjoyed his time in the gym ‰ÛÒ either training by himself or 'spotting' for his friends. 

He leaves behind his girlfriend Lauren, with whom he was looking forward to spending more time, a loving family, and a host of friends.

His subsequent postings were also to Germany based units: 1st Battalion Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards. 

He had served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and was on his second tour of Afghanistan as a Vehicle Mechanic in the Fitter Section of A Squadron, QDG. He was married to Wendy and father to three sons - Ethan, Harvey, and Dylan.

Corporal John was the epitome of a REME soldier: enthusiastic, determined, selfless, hardworking and loyal. He was a happy and loveable rogue who could always be found up to his elbows in the engine compartment of any vehicle that even looked like it needed some work. 

He had an enormous appetite for hard work and a tenacity that drove him to extraordinary lengths to fix problems. His inquisitive and active mind would analyse why some component had failed and seek a solution to avoid a reoccurrence. His consummate professionalism and wonderfully fun character made him a universally popular and respected member of the Fitter Section, Squadron and Regiment. He had a very bright future, having won an award for being the joint best Non-Commissioned Officer in the Light Aid Detachment of the Queen's Dragoon Guards and receiving a recommendation for Artificer training.

He was an avid motocross fan and had an addiction to anything mechanical. He loved his job and his mates and was never one to miss a party, but he was also a devoted husband and father. In the quieter moments of the tour he would speak lovingly of Wendy and with immense pride of his three boys. He leaves behind a gap in the Regiment, Squadron and Fitter Section that is irreplaceable and an even greater hole in a young family.

Having joined the Army, he completed his training in Guards Training Company, Catterick, in 2001 and joined 1st Battalion Welsh Guards when they were based in Aldershot. He qualified as a sniper, and served with distinction in Bosnia and Iraq, where his grasp of local customs and language quickly endeared him to the local community. His partner, Kelly, lives in Bridgend and his mother works in the Middle East.


""Lance Sergeant Fasfous was a superb soldier - one of the best of his generation. He was also a great character and a thoroughly decent man. His loss has been an enormous blow to his many friends in the Welsh Guards."" 
Lieutenant Colonel R S M Thorneloe MBE, 1st Battalion Welsh Guards
Tobie was a bright, popular individual who proved his flexibility in operational theatres as far apart as Bosnia, Iraq, and, most recently, Afghanistan. 

Each time, he showed himself undaunted by unfamiliar environments, and quickly demonstrated the compassion, understanding and professionalism of the British soldier on operations. He had intended to continue his career in the Army, and was interested in attempting pilot selection with the Army Air Corps to fly helicopters.

Tobie's mum, Anne Fasfous, said:

""We are all extremely proud of Tobie and the job he performed so bravely for his country. His sudden and tragic loss is being felt by his family, his partner and his many friends, both in the UK and in the UAE.""

His partner, Kelly Gore, said:

He served with his battalion in both Iraq and the Falkland Islands. Cpl Binnie passed the arduous Section Commanders' Battle Course last year and took command of his section in time to deploy on Operation HERRICK in Afghanistan in March, living and working amongst the Afghan troops. 

Cpl Binnie was an enthusiast by nature, with a strong, determined streak not always seen in one so young. He loved his job and was always the first to volunteer for extra courses - often doing them during leave as he claimed that otherwise he simply got bored. He was very much his own man but also a team player, which made him an excellent JNCO (Junior Non-Commissioned Officer).

He served on operations in Sierra Leone, Northern Ireland, Kosovo and Iraq. He then left the Army, to try something else, and spent time working in IT recruitment and for a Driving Agency. But it soon became clear that life as a 'civvie' was not for him and he returned to the battalion in time to begin pre-deployment training for Afghanistan.

He served in 8 Platoon, the Fire Support Platoon in B Company, 2 RIFLES. A Rifleman first and foremost, he was an extremely well-qualified driver and got stuck into the task of learning the Jackal, the vehicle he was to drive in Afghanistan. He set about learning his new job at the double and with an enviable alacrity. When not driving the Jackal, he also took his place in a Rifle Section as Machine Gunner.

Rfn Sheldon came from Kirkby-in-Ashfield; he was a Mansfield lad. He was an avid Mansfield Town supporter and followed the 'Stags' from a young age. He also supported Manchester United - an unprecedented mix. He also enjoyed rugby, socialising with friends, and TV sports, especially darts.

The son of a British Gurkha, he was always destined to try for selection to join one of the most feared regiments in the world and, after much effort, in 1996 he passed the gruelling selection and joined the British Army.

Following the successful completion of recruit training he was posted to Church Crookham as a Rifleman in A (Delhi) Company, 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles. In A Company he deployed on overseas exercises in Malaysia, Kenya, Oman and Belize, and had deployed on operations in Kosovo and Bosnia. This was his first deployment to Afghanistan. In his last posting before deployment to Afghanistan he was a section commander in the Jungle Warfare Wing in Brunei. He was an excellent jungle soldier with unique skills that he passed on to the course students in his own humorous manner.

As Second-in-Command of a Multiple in Afghanistan he had considerable responsibility, both for the administration of the fifteen-man team but also tactically, leading men in a most complex and dangerous operational environment. He was a highly valued member of a team that had the critical task of delivering vital training and mentoring to the Afghan National Police. 

He consistently proved himself to be a competent commander and mentor and through his own quiet and reassuring style became very successful at teaching the police. His calm and patient teaching style combined with his expert knowledge left a mark on many of the policemen he mentored. The work he conducted without doubt has enabled the police in Gereshk to become more professional and in time more respected by the Afghan civilians.

Corporal Kumar was a first-class soldier who loved soldiering and embraced the challenges it posed. He was a very intelligent and capable individual who spoke a number of languages including English, Hindi, his native Nepali and tribal languages. He was highly regarded and respected by all, a polite and quiet character who was a pleasure to be around. He was a good athlete and a fierce competitor on the sports field. His service to his battalion was characterised by the highest level of professionalism, loyalty and dedication.

In late 2005, Fusilier Suesue moved with the battalion to Cyprus and, during the Theatre Reserve Battalion commitment, deployed from Exercise Saffron Sands in Jordan to Iraq for four months, operating from Basra Palace.

On his return in November 2006, Pat went to Fiji, where he married Emalaini. On his return, he then deployed to Kabul with Fire Support Company, but was soon needed in Sangin with C Company as an integral part of their Javelin capability.

Once back in Cyprus, his wife Emalaini moved to join him in Dhekelia, and the Suesues moved with the battalion back to Hounslow, West London, in March 2008. After the move to London, Pat again distinguished himself as a key member of the Anti-Tank Platoon during Exercise Druids Dance, and then subsequently during the battalion's period of Public Duties in London. 

When called on to deploy to Afghanistan again, Fusilier Suesue threw himself into the challenge with his usual tenacity and enthusiasm, training as a Jackal heavy weapons gunner for A Company's Fire Support Group, now attached to 2nd Battalion The Rifles (2 RIFLES)Battle Group and based near Sangin.

Fusilier Suesue's family paid this tribute:

""Petero epitomised the qualities of the Fijian Fusilier. He was strong yet gentle, compassionate and always willing to support those around him. His ability to include everyone is indicative of his friendly nature and there will be a large hole left in the community with his passing.

""He leaves behind a loving wife, Emalaini, his mother, Sisilia, his sister, Litiana, and three brothers, Taito, Varasiko and Jovesa. It is with great sadness that Petero will no longer be with us in body; however, he leaves behind a legacy of love and affection in the memories of all who knew and loved him.""

","Sapper Rossi was aged 22 and came from West Yorkshire. He joined the Royal Engineers on 6 June 2006 and following his basic recruit training he attended further courses to qualify as both a Combat Engineer and a Military Engineer Bricklayer and Concreter. 

Posted in October 2007 to 38 Engineer Regiment, Ripon, North Yorkshire, he completed a construction task in Northern Ireland and then deployed to Kenya in support of 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (The Black Watch) Battle Group. On return to the UK he participated in the regimental move to a new permanent base at Massereene Barracks, Antrim, Northern Ireland. 

Following a period of intense training Sapper Rossi, or simply 'Rossi' as he was known to most of his friends, deployed to Afghanistan as an Advanced Searcher within the Joint Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group. His role was to support improvised explosive device disposal operations and provide a high assurance search capability to Task Force Helmand; a role in which he thrived immensely.

Sapper Rossi's mother, Mrs Theresa Rossi, said:

""I have just lost my precious fun-loving son. He was doing a job he loved and was proud to be a soldier. He was a tremendous son, grandson, brother, uncle and friend. There will be a big void in all our lives.""

He was single with no children. 

After completing infantry basic training at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick he joined C Company, 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Worcesters and Foresters), in 2006 at the age of 17.
 
He was true to his roots by being an ardent Nottingham Forest Football Club fan and true to his regiment with the pride he displayed in being a Mercian soldier.

He started his Army career in the Army Cadet Force where his larger than life character will be remembered by more than most; the story goes that the map and compass room was named after him! 

On arrival in the battalion, LCpl Hill deployed to Belize for a jungle training exercise in preparation for the Operation HERRICK 6 deployment to Helmand province. That deployment was a true test for all members of the battalion and it was a tour in which LCpl Hill distinguished himself. 

Shortly after the tour he attended and passed the Assault Pioneers Course followed by the Junior Non-Commissioned Officers' Cadre to achieve promotion to Lance Corporal. This was after an unusually short time which is testament to the ability of a relatively junior soldier. 

He was a very keen footballer who was regularly chosen to be in the company and battalion teams.


""He was professional, knowledgeable and commanded respect from every level. LCpl Hill would have gone far in the Mercian Regiment. As a comrade, he was the one that kept everybody smiling and where no job was too much trouble."" 
Major Bob Moorhouse, Officer Commanding C Company
Operation HERRICK 10 has seen the battalion deployed in the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team role, which seeks to build the capability of the Afghan National Army by living, working and fighting alongside the Afghan Army Warriors.

Soldiers are part of eight-man teams living in isolated locations in austere conditions. This requires a mental toughness which LCpl Hill had in spades; he was a true leader in the making. He always volunteered to deploy on operations and felt disappointed to be left in the patrol base.
 
Most of all 'Hilly's' sense of humour will be missed; true to the nature of a British Army soldier he would often play jokes on his mates.

LCpl Kieron Hill will be remembered by all as a brave and tough soldier who was a pleasure and inspiration to work with. He was an all-rounder who had everything required for a promising career in the true traditions of the British Army.

He was unmarried with no children.
 
He joined the Royal Marines in April 2002. Following successful completion of Royal Marine Recruit Training and the Commando Course he joined 45 Commando Royal Marines based in Arbroath, where he served as a Rifleman and then Section Second-in-Command and completed an operational tour of Northern Ireland. 

He then underwent the Armoured Support Operators Course qualifying him to operate the Viking All-Terrain Vehicle in May 2006. Following this he deployed for what was to be the first of three tours to Afghanistan.

LCpl Richards was a highly regarded and experienced Viking operator. He loved football and golf and participated in all unit social activities. His knowledge of the Viking vehicle and of Afghanistan was extensive and he was the source of much advice to those around him.
 
His courage under fire had been proven on numerous occasions during which he displayed great composure and skill. He led by example and was unafraid to place himself in danger in order to see the troop through a mission.
 
His dry sense of humour and dedication to his friends made him a driving force in the group. He left a lasting impression on everyone who came in contact with him. He will be sadly missed by the Armoured Support Group and the wider Royal Marine Corps.

""Stephen was a wonderful first born son, brother to two and friend to many; he was dearly loved and will be sorely missed. Stephen was always happy, caring and generous and we are sure that those fortunate enough to have known him will share in the loss we are now feeling.

""We can take some comfort knowing that he died amongst friends, doing something he loved and believed in. We are all immensely proud of him.

""We would ask that the press respect our need to grieve in private at this difficult time.""

His Commanding Officer said:

""Stephen was, quite simply, an extraordinary man doing an extraordinary job. He embodied a life based on service to others, duty and self-sacrifice - the life of a soldier. He chose this life and lived it with a passion; he died prematurely, but he died doing what he loved.

""He gave his all for his friends, for The Parachute Regiment and for the difficult task he faced. How privileged we are to have known this courageous and talented soldier and every member of the unit is very proud and deeply honoured to have served alongside him.

""We think now about his family; our thoughts and prayers are with them, and in the silence of their lives we hope they will draw strength from the same memories we all share.""

Of the two soldiers, Secretary of State for Defence John Hutton said: 

""Lance Corporal Nigel Moffett and Corporal Stephen Bolger paid the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, protecting the security of our nation. The comments of their comrades make clear that these two young men were soldiers of unusual determination and ability. This is a terribly sad loss for the Armed Forces, and I can only express my deepest sympathy to their grieving families.""

He joined The Light Dragoons in July 2003 and served on operations with Regimental Headquarters in Iraq in 2003 and C Squadron (The Legion) in Iraq in 2005 and Afghanistan in 2006. 

From the very beginning he showed an enthusiasm for soldiering that stood him apart from his peers. Keen to try his hand at everything, LCpl Moffett ran, boxed, cross-country skied, hill-walked and played rugby with the regiment. 

He was very much a regimental character, particularly due to his love of extreme physical challenges. He would routinely choose to carry the heavy General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) on endurance marches instead of his rifle. He carried his enthusiastic nature into the Corporals' Mess, where he could be relied on to be at the centre of any revelry. 

In September 2008, LCpl Moffett volunteered to join the Brigade Reconnaissance Force (BRF) for 19 Light Brigade, as the brigade began preparing for Operation HERRICK 10. The BRF is selected from across all of the units from the brigade and acts as the eyes and ears of the commander. 

LCpl Moffett quickly established himself as the fittest member of the unit. A Physical Training Instructor, he was responsible for running much of the subsequent BRF fitness training. He brought to the BRF knowledge of mobility procedures and long range communications and previous operational experience. 

This helped mould the BRF through seven arduous months of pre-deployment training, where LCpl Moffett showed his natural leadership and physical and mental robustness on many demanding exercises.

His performance on the Live Firing Test Exercise, conducted in Otterburn in January 2009, was nothing short of outstanding. In the worst environmental conditions, LCpl Moffett was fierce and relentless; attributes which he would call on more than once in the coming months.

The BRF deployed on Op HERRICK 10 in early April 2009 to Helmand province. LCpl Moffett was immediately at the forefront of the action as the driver of one of the lead vehicles in his troop.

He fought bravely in many engagements with the enemy, beginning with an advance against an enemy stronghold on 23 April. On 15 May, his troop was pinned down by heavy machine gun fire; LCpl Moffett rose to the challenge and mounted his GPMG on a rooftop, returning fire and giving his troop the breathing space to win the firefight.

","Rifleman Thatcher, aged 19, joined 2nd Battalion The Rifles in December 2007 and deployed almost immediately to Salisbury Plain on a Battle Group exercise with 10 Platoon, C Company.

Even as a new and junior Rifleman, he showed great promise from the outset. He won a battalion award for valour at the end of the testing exercise for preventing a counter-attack during a particularly tricky operation clearing a wood block.

His all-round qualities were confirmed when Rifleman Thatcher was selected to go to the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick as a mentor to new recruits. He was an exemplary role model. In summer 2008 he deployed on his first operational tour to Kosovo on Operation VALERO, where he thrived. On return, he threw himself into pre-deployment training as his company prepared for Afghanistan.

Life was full-on and he was involved in every turn of the training wheel. He performed brilliantly on the Battle Group's final exercise before deployment. At a particularly difficult moment on the confirmatory exercise, he stood up as a section commander, leading his fellow Riflemen through a wood clearance with great confidence and skill.

He deployed in April 2009 to Afghanistan as a General Purpose Machine Gunner, a testament to his strength and fitness. He had already been identified as a potential section second-in-command. He had set his heart on promotion or joining the Sniper Platoon after Afghanistan; he would have excelled whichever path he took for, quite simply, Rifleman Thatcher was a Rifleman of immense promise.

Rifleman Thatcher came from Caversham in Reading. His passions were Manchester United, all things football, and spending time with his two brothers and his parents.

Rifleman Thatcher's parents, Robin and Helena, and brothers Zac and Steely, gave the following tribute:

""Cyrus was a much-loved son and brother whose loss we will never recover from. He loved his job and was proud to serve his country. We will always be immensely proud of him. He will forever be in our hearts and minds.""

He was schooled at Bunnessan Primary and then Oban High School. Pte McLaren joined the Army in November 2007 and trained first at the Army Training Regiment in Winchester and then as a Royal Engineer in Surrey.

Pte McLaren ultimately decided to pursue a career as a Scottish infantryman and attended and comfortably passed the Combat Infantryman's Course at the Infantry Training Centre, Catterick. He passed out of 7 Platoon on 3 April 2009 and was posted to The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, on operations in southern Afghanistan.

Pte McLaren's family said:

""We are very proud of Robert; he died doing a job he loved and we will cherish fond memories of Robert for ever.""

Commanding Officer 3 SCOTS, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Cartwright, said:

""Private Robert McLaren has been cruelly taken from us after only four weeks of active service in The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.

""The battalion was conducting an offensive operation against the insurgents in one of the most dangerous parts of southern Afghanistan. His company had been engaged in close combat with the insurgents for several hours and Robert had displayed enormous physical courage during this battle for one so young.

""He gave his life for his friends with his selfless commitment, moving forward in the face of a determined and ruthless enemy. 

""From the moment he arrived he threw his heart and body into everything he was asked to do. He completed three large operations with his company and he made an immediate positive impression with his JNCOs [Junior Non-Commissioned Officers].

""Fit, keen to learn and easy company, Robert had so much going for him and was so proud to be on operations so soon in his career.

""Any death in this close-knit battalion delivers an emotional body blow, but the loss of this young man so soon after joining us has hit us particularly hard.""


""We are very proud of Robert; he died doing a job he loved and we will cherish fond memories of Robert for ever."" 
Private McLaren's family
Lt Col Cartwright continued:

""He has died in the service of his country, his regiment and for his friends in his platoon. On behalf of everyone in The Black Watch Battalion, I send my deepest condolences to his parents and wider family for their most tragic loss.

""He will be sorely missed by his many friends in the battalion and we will never forget him. We march forward on this most difficult task knowing that Robert would be urging us to do just that. Nemo me impune lacessit.""

Officer Commanding Alpha (Grenadier) Company, Major Matt Munro, said:

""Robert McLaren will be remembered as a trusted friend, a brave highland Jock and an enormously talented and decent man. His sudden death is a huge blow to all of us who were privileged and fortunate enough to soldier with him.

""Quietly confident, steady and assured he was an old head on young shoulders. Thoughtful and reflective, he had a ready smile, a wicked, dry sense of humour and an easy manner.

""Though he soldiered with us for barely a month he immediately won the respect and admiration of all of his brother Jocks; he made a tremendous impact in the short time that he served with us in Alpha (Grenadier) Company.

""Robert was a clever man who well understood the big picture; he was a 'canny' Jock who was as comfortable when robustly defeating the insurgents as he was compassionate when interacting with Afghan civilians.

""He was in his element here in Afghanistan. On his first operation, just a month out of recruit training, he left an indelible impression on his brother Jocks when in his first contact he fearlessly and decisively engaged insurgents at close range.

""He was killed two weeks later by an improvised explosive device as, once again, under accurate and sustained fire he pushed himself forward to support his imperilled colleagues.

""This was typical of the man who without hesitation, question or thought for his personal safety, repeatedly pushed himself to the fore.

""Our grief is seemingly overwhelming but nothing compared to that which his family must be suffering. They are in our thoughts and prayers.

""If Robert were still with us I am clear that as a proud and determined Grenadier he would be urging us forward. Robert will be sorely missed but never forgotten. Nemo me impune lacessit.""

",7/14/09 18:28,8/28/09 10:045999,Mervis,Paul,,Lieutenant,Dead,M,27,London,Britain,Britain,Britain,,,2nd Battalion The Rifles,,,,6/12/09 0:00,6/12/09 0:00,Action,"Helmand province (Sangin), Afghanistan",as a result of an explosion during a deliberate operation,"Lieutenant Paul Mervis, born on 30 September 1981, grew up in London and was educated at King's College Wimbledon. He then spent a gap year in China and Israel before going on to study philosophy at University College London. 

Summer holidays were invariably spent in Africa in the Namibian bush. Post graduation, his passion for geo-politics and travel led him into the world of journalism where he was involved with 'The Week' and 'The Spectator'. But it wasn‰Ûªt long before his thirst for adventure drew him into the British Army. 

Lt Mervis was one of the very first officers to commission into the newly formed RIFLES in April 2007. After the testing Platoon Commanders' Course at Brecon, he was posted to 2 RIFLES as the Platoon Commander of 10 Platoon and he was straight into the mix.

He led his platoon with distinction on a demanding TESEX (Tactical Electronic Simulation Exercise) before deploying with the Battle Group to Kosovo, where he thrived on his first operational tour. He was in his element in the diversity of that place and it soon showed that he was an operational soldier who relished overseas deployments.

2 RIFLES then entered an intensive period of pre-deployment training for HERRICK 10 (Afghanistan) and, for Lt Mervis, the operation could not come soon enough. Lt Mervis' unique character and leadership forged a very special platoon.

Every exercise and training serial, whether platoon, company or battalion, was tackled with the vigour, thoroughness and professionalism of someone who cared passionately about his Riflemen and who was prepared to strain every sinew in preparing for the demands of operations in Helmand. During his first two months of the tour, based out of Forward Operating Base (FOB) Gibraltar as part of Battle Group (North), Lt Mervis was at the forefront of all his company's operations.

He fought hard and led his platoon through tragic times; when Rifleman Thatcher was killed in action he was a rock to those he commanded. It was typical of the man that he led from the front in one of Afghanistan's most demanding and dangerous districts. Tragically, Lieutenant Paul Mervis was killed whilst on a foot patrol by an explosion north of FOB Gibraltar on 12 June 2009.

Lt Mervis' family, Jonathan and Margaret, Hannah and Jack Mervis, said: 

""Paul was a wonderful, loving son, brother and friend - generous and thoughtful, with an infectious sense of fun. Paul was killed doing the job he chose and loved. He was passionately committed to his men - far beyond mere duty. He had read widely about Afghanistan, and went with a genuine desire to help bring enough stability there to enable reconstruction to follow.""

He was educated at St Peter's Catholic Comprehensive School, Guildford, and later at Plymouth University, where he was a member of the Exeter University Officer Training Corps. 

He attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1999, and was commissioned into the Welsh Guards on 11 December 1999. He served as a Platoon Commander both on ceremonial duties in London and on exercise in the jungles of Belize. After a stint as the Regimental Signals Officer he returned to the Belizean jungle in charge of jungle warfare training. Following Staff College in 2006-2007 he worked in the Permanent Joint Headquarters, Northwood, but was brought back from that job early to command the newly formed IX Company in Afghanistan.

Major Sean Birchall was the Officer Commanding (OC) Number IX Company, 1st Battalion Welsh Guards. IX Company is based in Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital of Helmand province. Early in IX Company's time in Afghanistan Major Birchall led them on a large operation where they operated alongside the Afghan National Army to drive the Taliban out of a village called Basharan which is 10km north west of Lashkar Gah. Under Major Birchall's inspired leadership the company distinguished itself on this operation and subsequently Basharan became part of the Company's 'patch'. IX Company was therefore responsible, together with the Afghan National Security Forces, for protecting the people of Basharan and helping them to develop their village. 

Major Birchall was enormously proud of the regiment - a Welsh Guardsman through and through. He was a highly capable officer, and excelled at all he did. He was devoted to the men under his command, and they had enormous respect for him. He had a very bright future ahead of him in the Army. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him. Major Birchall leaves behind his wife, Joanna, and their 18-month-old son, Charlie.


""It is the excellence he achieved in every facet of his life that defined Sean. An athlete, an adventurer and an instinctive leader, he was an inspiration to all who knew him. He leaves behind his adoring family, the regiment he loved, and his loyal friends. They will miss him terribly."" 
Joanna Birchall
Major Birchall's wife Joanna paid this tribute: 

""Sean was a wonderful husband, a doting father and a much-loved son and brother, who cared deeply for his family and friends. 

""He has been described as 'devilishly fit, stylish and energetic' and he was so very proud to be a Guards Officer. He was also thrilled to have the opportunity to lead a newly-formed company in Afghanistan and, despite spending such a short time with his Guardsmen, he was utterly devoted to them. He would want them to continue with courage and commitment and to come home safely when the job is done.

Lieutenant Colonel Marcus Simson, Commanding Officer 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, said:

""Trooper Joshua Hammond enlisted in the Army aged 16-and-a-half and attended the Army Foundation College in Harrogate to complete his initial training. From Harrogate, having been accepted into the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, Trooper Hammond moved to Bovington to learn his trade as a Challenger 2 tank driver.

""He arrived with the regiment in Tidworth in May 2008, shortly before his 18th birthday, and within months had deployed with his squadron to Canada where he spent a happy and fulfilling three months training on the prairie. He quickly established himself as a professional and capable young soldier, full of potential and with a future full of promise. 

""On his return from Canada, Trooper Hammond volunteered to change squadron in order to deploy to Afghanistan. He threw himself into life in his new squadron, the pre-deployment training, and his conversion to the Viking vehicle that he would be operating in theatre.

""He deployed with his squadron to Afghanistan exactly a month ago. In the month he had in theatre, he proved himself to be a superb soldier. Fit, courageous, and robust, he was the first to volunteer, the first to muck in, and the first to offer help to others. But he was so much more than that.

""For he was at the heart of everything that was going on. He was full of laughter, was always ready to listen and he cared deeply about his mates. 

""Known regimentally as Josh, Trooper Hammond died on patrol doing the job he loved, amongst his friends, the week before his 19th birthday.

""He was proud to be a Tankie, and we are proud to have served with him. His tragic death has left a vast hole in our hearts - both those in his squadron in Afghanistan and those of us left behind in the UK.

""Our thoughts at this time are with his family and friends, but most particularly with his parents and his fiancÌ©e.""

Major Charlie Burbridge, Officer Commanding Egypt Squadron, 2 RTR, said: 

""Hammy joined 2 RTR in May 2008 and it was clear from the outset that he was going to be a fine soldier. He took pride in his fitness and was determined to be the best tank driver he could be. He succeeded.

""He also succeeded in being admitted into the Egypt bad tattoo club and very swiftly became a central figure in the squadron. 

""Hammy was a quiet, unassuming but highly courageous young man with a roguish sense of humour. Earnest, thoughtful and happy, he was an essential part of my squadron and he died, a week before his nineteenth birthday, doing a fine job as a proud soldier.

""He had a glint in his eye and a wry smile which always made one feel that you were in on the joke. He was professional and capable and was only just getting into his stride as a soldier. Only days before his tragic death he had said how much he was enjoying the job.

""My words will do little to console his mother or fiancÌ©e whom he planned to marry on his return from Afghanistan but our prayers are for them. Hammy was a Tankie, through and through; I am proud to have served alongside him and we will never forget him.""

His courageous, thoughtful stewardship of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards since October last year has seen them superbly prepared for the demands of Afghanistan, both in terms of their professional capability and their unbreakable spirit as a team.

""At the leading edge of his generation, his loss will be felt deeply not only by his family but also by his soldiers and others, who like me, had the privilege to serve with him.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of both these highly capable and popular soldiers - as well as with the entire Battle Group, for whom the loss of their Commanding Officer will have been a particularly bitter blow. 

""However, this tragic incident has only served to strengthen our resolve and commitment to succeed in bringing stability and prosperity to Helmand province. We will remember them both.""

Secretary of State for Defence, Bob Ainsworth, said:

""It was with great sadness that I heard of the deaths of Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe and Trooper Joshua Hammond in a single incident in Afghanistan yesterday.

""Lieutenant Colonel Thorneloe's death is a hard blow to the Welsh Guards, to Task Force Helmand and to the British Army.

""I knew him myself as a man of incisive thought, enormous professionalism and the greatest decency who could not wait to leave the high profile post in the Ministry of Defence where he had performed so impressively in order to take command of his battalion on operations.

""He saw it as the best job he would ever do, but I know that his genuinely exceptional abilities would have ensured him a brilliant career. As his own thorough and thoughtful tributes to those who fell before him show, he led his men with energy, care and pride - and he died leading his men.

""I cannot imagine a finer officer to have had in the front rank of the British Army, and his loss is all the harder.

""Trooper Joshua Hammond was by all accounts an exemplary soldier, popular with his comrades and a true family man.

""Tributes to his bravery, skill and commitment to his friends and family paint a picture of a good and much-loved man whose contribution and presence will be hugely missed by all those who knew him.

""At this terribly sad time, our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of these two fine men.""

His basic training started at the Army Foundation College, Harrogate, which prepares young men for the rigours of the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick. After completing the Combat Infantryman's Course in March of this year he passed off the square at Catterick and deployed to Helmand province to join B Company.

Known to friends as Robbie, Private Laws was killed alongside his mates in B Company while they were operating under command of The Light Dragoons Battle Group during Operation PANCHAI PALANG.

Private Laws, from Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, was a popular member of his platoon during training and achieved 'Best Shot' on the Light Machine Gun. When Robbie arrived at 2 MERCIAN he quickly became known for his mischievous sense of humour and a cheeky wit which endeared him well to his Platoon Sergeant.

To undertake basic training and be on the front line in Afghanistan within a year is a tremendous undertaking, especially for someone who is 18 years old. Private Laws rose to this challenge by embracing all the best qualities of being a soldier: ability to adapt and learn; strength of character; and determination.


Private Laws' family issued the following statement: 

""The parents and close family are immensely proud of their popular and loving son. They would like to thank all their friends for their loving support at this very difficult time.""

Lieutenant Colonel Simon Banton, Commanding Officer of 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Worcesters and Foresters), said: 

""Robbie only joined 2 MERCIAN (Worcesters and Foresters) a very short time ago but had already begun to make his mark. He was excited and eager to deploy to Afghanistan and this only a few days after his 18th birthday. 

""He was a warm and cheerful young man who mucked in when there was work to be done and quickly made friends. Robbie's falling has taken a good soldier from us; a man who was not afraid to move forward, endure hardship, and he had the courage to fight the enemy alongside his brothers. 

""Robbie died alongside his mates in B Company, 2 MERCIAN, and his death has rocked them - they will hold him in their hearts as they fight on. The entire regiment's prayers are with Robbie's family who are devastated by his loss.""

He had deployed as part of The Light Dragoons' Command Troop and was responsible for ensuring radio communications for the Commanding Officer's tactical headquarters, both on foot and on vehicles. 

Having just helped to secure a helicopter landing site for the extraction of casualties from an earlier incident, Lance Corporal Dennis was amongst a group hit by an improvised explosive device, and sustained fatal injuries.

Lance Corporal Dennis was born on 16 May 1980. He joined the Army on 14 February 2003 as a gunner in the Royal Artillery before joining The King's Troop. Having served with the Gunners for just over two years, he was attached to The Light Dragoons for a six-month tour of Iraq in 2005. Having struck up strong friendships over the six months, he applied to transfer and joined the regiment in February 2006. Lance Corporal Dennis was on his second tour of Afghanistan. He leaves behind his mother Adele, of Llanelli, as well as his twin brother Gareth and his fiancÌ©e Lisa.

Lance Corporal Dennis was a quietly spoken and popular soldier; fiercely loyal to his friends. He was known throughout the regiment simply as 'Duke' - a nickname of which he was hugely proud. He believed wholeheartedly in what he was doing and would always back himself to the hilt.

Lance Corporal Dennis loved the banter that typifies Army life, and he could give as good as he got, though he had the character to laugh at himself as well. He loved the gym, and would jokingly show off his muscles at any opportunity. He took great pride in mentoring and looking after the junior members of his troop, and he would be one of the first they would turn to for advice and guidance.

Ambitious and determined, Lance Corporal Dennis wanted to pursue the dismounted side of Formation Reconnaissance, and had volunteered to attend Junior Brecon on his return and wanted to serve in the Brigade Reconnaissance Force in the future.


Lance Corporal Dennis' family issued the following statement:

""David was strong man and a courageous soldier who died doing a job that he loved. He was very proud to serve in The Light Dragoons and enjoyed life as a soldier which he lived to the full. We as a family are extremely proud and honoured to have been a part of his life and that pride extends to all of our young men and women serving overseas.""

His father Roger also said:

""David was everything a father could ask for in a son and I am 
incredibly proud of him. He wanted to join the Army from a young age and very quickly the Army became his second family. He was larger than life. Handsome, strong and someone you would want by your side when times got tough. 

""The Army was his life and he had so many friends there that he loved so much. He crammed more into his 29 years than most people did in a lifetime. I was so pleased he decided to settle down when he met a wonderful girl Lisa and I was looking forward to sharing their future. We had all decided to celebrate New Year in New York and David bossed his stepmum Helen in every call from Afghanistan to organise our trip.

""He was deeply caring of his younger brother Matthew, 14, and even whilst in Afghanistan he wanted to know his exam results and told him to revise hard. He'll be in my heart forever and life will never ever be the same again and our thoughts are with his comrades and pray they come home safely.""
Lieutenant Colonel Gus Fair DSO, Commanding Officer, The Light Dragoons Battle Group, said: 

""Lance Corporal Dennis was one of a hugely talented generation of Light Dragoons. With tours of Afghanistan and Iraq behind him, he was experienced beyond his relatively junior years. Duke loved being in the regiment, and the regiment celebrated this popular, genuine and heartfelt soldier. 

""If there is any consolation it is that he is reunited with his close friend Lance Corporal Nigel Moffett, whose death earlier in the tour had affected Lance Corporal Dennis greatly. My sincerest condolences go out to his mother Adele, his brother Gareth and his fiancÌ©e Lisa. We will remember Lance Corporal Dennis; we will be worthy of his memory; we will continue to take the fight to the enemy that has taken him from us.""

His family now lives in Bridgend in Wales. Having joined the Army, he completed his training in Guards Training Company, Catterick, in 2004 and joined the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards when they were based at RAF St Athan, near Cardiff.

He served in Iraq in 2004/05, and in Bosnia in 2006/07. He passed a promotion course and was promoted to Lance Corporal during the pre-deployment training for Afghanistan.

Lance Corporal Elson was a keen rugby player and he lived for the mates he had around him in the Welsh Guards. He had a very bright future ahead of him, and stood out as a Guardsman destined for the higher ranks of the battalion.


""For Lance Corporal Elson's friends, no night out was complete without his presence."" 
Major Andrew Speed MBE
Lieutenant Colonel Gus Fair, Commanding Officer, The Light Dragoons Battle Group, said:

""Lance Corporal Elson was part of a small band of Welsh Guards attached to the Battle Group. Despite being small in number, they have made a huge impact with their professionalism, drive and determination to take the fight to the enemy. Lance Corporal Elson was one of the best of these. It is typical of the man that he died while providing cover to the rest of his platoon. Though Lance Corporal Elson is no longer with us, his fellow Welsh Guardsmen, and the Battle Group, will remember this talented and popular soldier.""

His Battalion Second-in-Command, Major Andrew Speed MBE, said:

""Lance Corporal Elson was a dedicated and loyal Welsh Guardsman who had been with the battalion for five years. He was promoted shortly before his deployment to Afghanistan and was looking forward to an undoubtedly bright future. 

""Lance Corporal Elson was a Javelin operator with one of the fire support groups, a job he relished. He was extremely fit and was mentally very tough. Prior to deployment, Lance Corporal Elson broke his wrist while learning to drive a quad bike. This meant that his deployment would be delayed. So keen was he to deploy with his fellow Welsh Guardsmen that he suggested to his Section Commander that he should cut off his plaster and pretend that his wrist was fine. To his disappointment, he was forced to wait for his wrist to heal.


""Lance Corporal Elson was a true friend and comrade. He always had a smile on his face. He was a cracking soldier and will not be forgotten."" 
Lance Sergeant Dan Collins
""With Lance Corporal Elson's belated deployment came his characteristic energy and enthusiasm, which made an immediate impact on his friends and fellow Welsh Guardsmen serving in the small contingent of Guardsmen attached to The Light Dragoons. He was soon in his element, and could not have been a more effective Team Commander on operations - he galvanised his team and was the fully rounded article. It was so typical of Lance Corporal Elson to have been providing cover and looking out for his mates when he died, he lived his life with a very selfless ethos which inspired others.

""Outside of the Army he was a man whose company others would seek. His friends describe him as being as sociable as a young Guardsman can be; he was universally regarded as being reliably good for morale. For Lance Corporal Elson's friends, no night out was complete without his presence.

""In the same manner that we have dealt with our previous tragic losses, the Welsh Guards will bear this loss with fortitude and determination. In the knowledge that our fallen will have wanted nothing more than for us to continue with even greater determination and stoicism, we will continue undaunted by our losses.""

After graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and completing the Royal Engineers Troop Commanders' Course he joined 22 Engineer Regiment in April 2007. 

He deployed shortly afterwards to Iraq as a Troop Commander in 5 Armoured Engineer Squadron where he quickly showed that he was an exceptionally gifted leader. It was a demanding tour but he thrived in that environment, earning the respect of all who served with him there. 

Once Captain Babington-Browne returned from Iraq, he was selected to run the Regimental Junior Non-Commissioned Officers' Cadre; a testing course which trains and prepares Sappers for promotion to Lance Corporal. As Cadre Officer he was an exemplary model of leadership for the Sappers on the course and in many ways will have influenced those young soldiers for the rest of their careers.

Trooper Whiteside was born on 22 August 1988 in Blackpool. He joined the Army in July 2005 as an Infanteer in The Queen's Lancashire Regiment (QLR). Having served with the QLR for just over one year, he was discharged after suffering a serious knee injury. But still determined to serve his country, he joined up again when fully fit as a formation reconnaissance soldier in The Light Dragoons in March 2008.

Trooper Whiteside, initially quiet on arriving at regimental duty in November 2008, thrived in Afghanistan. His hardworking nature, concern for others and selflessness endeared him to all who worked alongside him. 

As a small group of Light Dragoons attached to an infantry company, his troop had a very different challenge to the rest of the regiment, which brought them closer still. 

Trooper Whiteside was on his first tour of Afghanistan. He leaves behind his mother Diane and her partner Malcolm, as well as younger brother Dan.

Lieutenant Colonel Gus Fair, Trooper Whiteside's Commanding Officer, said:

""Trooper Whiteside had only been in the regiment for a short time, but had established a reputation as an excellent soldier. Fit, robust and determined, he had all the qualities that mark out a soldier of considerable promise, and he was at the top of his peers. 

""Norm had been tested in some of the most intense fighting ever experienced in Afghanistan for four days prior to his death and had never been found wanting. As part of the Fire Support Group, he had led 3rd Platoon from the front all day during fighting in the heat and demanding terrain. He will be remembered as a soldier at the top of his profession, who gave his all for his friends, and who has been cruelly taken from us.""

""Daniel passed out of Catterick as top recruit and since joining the Army he was the happiest we had known him, he had truly found his place in the world. He believed in what the British Army was trying to achieve and was confident. He was proud to serve his country and was planning to move battalion when he returned so that he could guarantee a speedy return to Afghanistan. 

""We have lost a son and a best friend, his death has left a huge void in our lives, we are fiercely proud of him.""

His Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Jones MBE, said: 

""Rifleman Daniel Hume always said that he wanted one day to be RSM [Regimental Serjeant Major] of the battalion. This may at first appear to be an arrogant boast from a young soldier, but in his case it was anything but this. He was an exceptionally gifted young man who wanted to genuinely do something with his life and it would have been a brave man to bet against him to achieve his ambitions. 

""He only arrived in the battalion at the end of April having just passed out from ITC Catterick where he was the Top Student. However, he was no stranger to success despite being only 22. He was a keen snowboarder, but his passion was downhill mountain bike racing and it was a passion for which he had a genuine talent. 

""He started racing at the age of 12 joining the Mountain Bike UK/Scott bikes squad in 2002. By the end of the season he was third in the national rankings, with six wins to his name. It was clear even at this stage that he was a genuine star in the making. More success followed and in 2004 he came 42nd in the Downhill World Cup. Rifleman Hume was a young man with extraordinary talent and a real thirst for life.

""He was born in Slough, before moving to Maidenhead where he was educated at Furze Platt Senior School and then at Reading College. Despite his talent on a bike he accepted that he wouldn't make a living from it and a career in the military beckoned. Initially he headed towards the Royal Marines, attending the Commando Course in 2007. Displaying his typical determination and physical ability, he was nearing the end of the course when he took himself off for personal reasons. Over the next year he worked for a courier company before the call of the bugle drew him to the Army. 

""The Royal Marines' loss was The Rifles' gain. In training he was nothing short of a star; always first in everything, immaculately turned out, but always there for his mates and up for a laugh. When his friends were struggling, he was there for them with a kind and encouraging word and assistance. He was a natural prankster and up for a challenge, but despite this mischievous streak, like the very best Riflemen, he was never caught.

""He arrived in 4 RIFLES at a difficult time with the bulk of pre-deployment training completed, but it was testament to his quick and confident manner that he settled into his platoon making an immediate impact. He was a true professional, utterly determined in everything he did, and it was no surprise that he rapidly mastered the skills that he would need in Afghanistan. In his short time in Helmand, he came to be a Rifleman that both his friends and commanders could totally rely upon, no matter what the task. 

""He was a man with boundless energy, naturally fit and a sportsman, with exceptional motivation and will to succeed. Despite all of his ability, he was truly humble and was just one of the Riflemen - loved and trusted. In difficult times you need men of character who rise to the immense challenges that we ask of our young men; Rifleman Hume was one such man. He had become a rock within his section that belied his relative inexperience. With depth beyond his years, he had an unusually mature head on his shoulders.


""His brother Riflemen have been robbed of a future leader, who would over the coming years have been at the forefront of his generation."" 
Commanding Officer Lt Col Rupert Jones MBE
""In the short time he was with 4 RIFLES he made a huge impact within B Company. Identified from the outset as a star of the future, he drew rare praise from his Company Serjeant Major and even the senior Riflemen had come to rely on him.

""Rifleman Hume was the epitome of the Thinking Rifleman. Early promotion beckoned and he had his eye on a move to the Sniper Platoon to join some of our very finest Riflemen. The snipers sit at the heart of The Rifles tradition and he would have excelled with them. Mature and perceptive, his aspiration for the year was to complete the tour safely. Cruel fate has denied him this. 

""His brother Riflemen have been robbed of a future leader, who would over the coming years have been at the forefront of his generation. However, his family have lost much more - they have lost a beloved brother and son. The thoughts and prayers of everyone in the 4 RIFLES family are with them at this tragic time.

One of the rounds struck him, and despite immediate medical attention there was nothing that could be done for him.

Private Brackpool was born on 11 July 1981 in Crawley, West Sussex. He joined the Army and served with The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (PWRR), during which time he deployed on operations to Kosovo and Iraq. He had left the Regular Army, but volunteered to serve with 1st Battalion Welsh Guards for a six-month operational tour to Afghanistan.

Although his time with the Welsh Guards was short, he had settled in well and quickly become a popular member of his platoon. He leaves behind his parents, his partner, and his young son. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him.

His Battle Group Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Doug Chalmers MBE PWRR, said:

""Private Brackpool was a superb soldier who had learnt his trade as a member of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, serving with them in both Kosovo and Iraq. After a number of years he left the 'Pick of the South', as he affectionately referred to them, and entered civilian life. But before long he joined up as a reservist to serve with the Welsh Guards for their tour of duty in Afghanistan. 

""It is a mark of the man that he settled quickly and earned his platoon's respect in a matter of days. He was easy-going, hard working and had that kind of waterproof smile that kept morale going when things got tough. 

""His loss has been an enormous blow to his many friends in the Welsh Guards and those that remember him in The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. But we are all very conscious that our loss is nothing compared to the one being felt by his family, partner and son. Our hearts go out to them at this extremely distressing time."" 

His Company Commander, Major Giles Harris, said: 

""Private Brackpool joined the Prince of Wales‰Ûªs Company as a regular reservist and instantly became popular amongst the Welsh Guardsmen he had volunteered to serve with in Afghanistan. He was an extremely likeable and engaging man. His laid back attitude and tremendous sense of humour - most often at his own expense - made him a hugely valued member of his platoon who quickly came to know him as 'Bracks'. 

""That an Englishman could be so quickly and genuinely brought into the fold of a Welsh platoon - one which had already seen considerable action before his arrival - was a testament to his remarkable character and good nature. 

""As a soldier he was committed, a team player, and enthusiastic in contact with the enemy. Having already completed two tours of Kosovo and one of Iraq he brought a huge amount of experience with him, yet he was humble, down to earth and took each day as it came. 

""Private Brackpool was with us for only a short time but will leave a lasting impression on all that met him, especially those in his platoon who had the privilege and pleasure of living and fighting alongside this charming, unselfish, friendly and genuine soldier.""

His Platoon Commander, Lieutenant Dave Harris, said:

""Private Brackpool joined two months into our tour and made a quick impression upon us all. He had a permanent smile etched across his face and appeared to relish being part of a close knit team despite the austere conditions. He was blessed with a wonderful sense of humour and a truly happy go lucky attitude. All of us in 2 Platoon will remember Private Brackpool as a genuine, compassionate and likeable man who gave his life protecting his comrades.

Soon after joining, he was deployed to Kosovo on Op VALERO where he was employed as a Rifleman within a section. After returning to Ballykinler the Battalion's focus switched to its future deployment to Afghanistan. During the pre-deployment training he showed an aptitude for all things communications and was subsequently employed as the Platoon Signaller, a pivotal role. 

During one of the pre-deployment exercises he demonstrated potential beyond his experience and showed his Platoon Staff that he had the metal to earn a place on the next Potential Junior NCOs Cadre.

He was a determined, rigorous and thoughtful young man who saw the lighter side of life. He loved his rugby and his football and his heart was set on being a PTI [physical training instructor] - it would have been right up his street. He was always at the front when we ran on the beach in Ballykinler. He had lungs big enough for the rest of his Platoon. We were jealous. 

""He was utterly selfless and always the first man in his company to welcome new Riflemen. He is sorely missed and his family are front and centre of our prayers at this unimaginably difficult time.""

Major Alistair Field, Officer Commanding C Company 2 RIFLES: 

""A gritty-sounding Yorkshireman; Rifleman Backhouse was in my select group of Riflemen that were being put forward to attempt the gruelling JNCO Cadre on return from Afghanistan . He was quickly accepted by his fellow Riflemen as one of the lads and as someone who could be relied on. This tour had brought out the best in Rifleman Backhouse. He was 'always on the ramparts' as we say and quick to volunteer for any task, especially those which took the fight to the enemy - there were many of those. His sense of service was humbling.""

He attended Minster College in Leominster and was keen on Martial Arts. 

Rifleman Will Aldridge joined C Company 2 RIFLES in Ballykinler, Northern Ireland, in December 2008 at seventeen years of age, after attending The Army Foundation College at Harrogate and completing his Infantry Training in Catterick. Rifleman Aldridge completed pre-deployment training for Afghanistan with his Platoon but was unable to deploy on tour until he turned 18 on 23 May 2009. Rifleman Aldridge played a key role with the Battalion's Rear Party in Ballykinler, guarding the families of those already in Afghanistan until he was old enough to deploy himself. Rifleman Aldridge was fiercely proud of being one of the very youngest British soldiers in Helmand.

Rifleman Aldridge was killed by an IED blast in Sangin on 10 July 2009 whilst helping to extract casualties from a previous explosion in which he too had been injured.

He leaves behind his mother, Lucy, and two young brothers, George and Archie.

He attended the Section Commander‰Ûªs Battle Course in Brecon in 2008 and was promoted to corporal in the middle of pre-deployment training. 

Corporal Horne served with distinction as both a Green Jacket and as a member of the Rifles in Iraq between 2006 and 2007 (where he was wounded in action) and on peacekeeping operations in Kosovo in 2008. He was hugely proud to deploy to Afghanistan as a Section Commander and relished the opportunity of commanding Riflemen in battle. Tragically, Corporal Horne was killed in action by an IED (improvised explosive device) blast on the morning of 10 July 2009 in Sangin. 

He leaves behind his beloved wife Rachel, his children Frankie and Jessica, his parents and three brothers.

Corporal Horne's wife, Rachel:

""A sad farewell to my wonderful husband who was a devoted father, husband and a loving son. We will miss you more than words could ever describe. You were the most caring, thoughtful, funniest, loving and generous person I have ever known. You were so brave and we are all so proud of what you have done. We will always love and miss you.

å¦   That hard work paid off: He was allowed to oversee the armory at the base. It was the same hard work and determination that got him into the service. When he was 17, he was insistent on becoming a Marine, his mother said. She made him wait a year.

He was always eager and proud to be a Fusilier and Infantryman. 

On arrival in the Battalion, Cpl Etchells joined B Company 6 Platoon in Palace Barracks, Belfast subsequently moving to with the Battalion Cyprus.  Whilst in Cyprus he deployed with A Company Group to Now Zad, Afghanistan in 2006 as a Fusilier in 6 Platoon.  He returned to Cyprus from Afghanistan and in June 2007 he passed his Junior NCO cadre moving to A Company on promotion. 

Whilst in Cyprus he represented the Battalion and Garrison side at cricket and was an active member of the Battalion cross country team.  In late 2007 Cpl Etchells deployed to Jordan on Exercise Saffron Sands and showed huge potential for the future in his Army career.  On the Battalion's return from Cyprus to UK he secured a place on the Section Commander's Battle Course in June 2008 a course he passed with ease and was promoted to Cpl soon after.

When called on to deploy to Afghanistan again, he was the ultimate professional ensuring his Section were fully prepared for their role in Helmand.  His dedication and loyalty to his men was evident from the moment he took over his Section. Cpl Etchells was an enthusiastic and dedicated individual who loved his job, cared about his men and was the consummate professional.  He will be sorely missed.

å¦   Burrow, 23, of Naples, Fla., drove home from Camp Lejeune many weekends to visit his mother, and made time to call from Afghanistan and make sure she and his brother, Army Spc. Chris Burrow, were safe. He was killed by a roadside bomb in Helmand province the next day, Aug. 7.
å¦   ""He was a very warm, loving kid, bright but impulsive,"" said his mother, Daryl. ""I just feel his spirit with me all the time.""
å¦   Burrow graduated in 2004 from Magruder High School in Rockville, Md., then fled the frosty winters to be a bartender in Florida. Then in 2006, Dennis fulfilled his childhood dream and joined the Marines.
å¦   He is survived by his father, R. Morgan Burrow, and his mother, brother and sister.

The Company had experienced considerable success since the beginning of the operation. Lance Sergeant Walker was responsible for commanding and leading a four man 'fire team' in engaging and reassuring the local population as well as defeating the insurgents. The success the Company had been experiencing was in no small part due to the extraordinary leadership and guidance of Lance Sergeant Walker.

Lance Sergeant David ""Davey"" Walker was born in Glasgow on 9 August 1973. He passed out of the Guards Depot in Pirbright in 1993. He immediately joined the 1st Battalion Scots Guards and served in Dungannon in 1994, Belfast in 1996 and on Operation TELIC 5 in Iraq in 2004/2005.

Lance Sergeant Walker was also employed as an instructor at ITC Catterick where he excelled in passing on his abundance of experience and wealth of knowledge to the recruits he was training.

Lance Sergeant Walker was the absolute epitome of a first class Scots Guardsman who always led his men from the front. He will be remembered for his passion for fishing, football and for Celtic Football Club. He will be missed for his sense of fun, his unselfishness and his unshakable loyalty to his friends.

Lance Sergeant Walker never thought of himself first' he was a loving son and brother to all his fellow Scots Guardsmen. He was and always will be forever a Scots Guardsman. The thoughts of every one of his colleagues are with his family and, in particular, his wife Teresa and their family.

Lance Sergeant Walker was a man with a great deal of promise. He was fit, strong, smart, enthusiastic and professional in his approach. Indeed, he was everything a professional soldier should aspire to be. Right Flank are enormously privileged to have known Lance Sergeant Walker. He was a great comrade, a brilliant soldier with a very bright future and a great friend to so many.

Lance Sergeant Walker's tragic loss has been felt very deeply by those in the Scots Guards who he leaves behind ‰ÛÒ particularly his platoon and those whom he had served with in the Left Flank. He has left a huge hole in the company that will be hard to fill.

After passing the Platoon Commanders' Battle Course in April 2008 he arrived in the Battalion, which had just returned from Operation HERRICK 7. He took over his first Platoon in Number 3 Company and quickly established himself as an extremely capable young officer.

As a Platoon Commander based in Windsor, life is busy with the full spectrum of State Ceremonial occasions and Public Duties. Lieutenant Dalzell rose to the task with a commendably positive attitude; his leadership and drive kept his Platoon motivated and focused on the challenges of the tour in Afghanistan. 

He engaged fully in preparing for the multifaceted demands an operational deployment to Afghanistan generates. It was this that really gripped his imagination. With an eye for detail unusual of one so junior, he created training opportunities for his soldiers that stood them all in good stead. To fit this around his duties in London was impressive.

In early 2009 Lieutenant Dalzell moved into Number 1 Company to take command of Number 2 Platoon and it was with them that he deployed to Afghanistan in October 2009. He was devoted to this Platoon and those in it, to him. The rapport and trust quickly gained between him and his men was hugely significant in building a team of professional soldiers eager to deploy to Afghanistan and prove themselves.

Lieutenant Dalzell didn't take his task lightly. He was a professional of the highest standards; a role model for his generation of officers. He led by example and from the front, never asking a soldier to do a job that he hadn't previously done himself.

His Platoon Sergeant, Sergeant Amer, was killed on 30 November 2009 and he carried the burden of losing not only a critical professional colleague, but also a close friend, in the most unselfish way. His courage and leadership over the past four months have been nothing short of astonishing and all those around him have been infected by it. To be praised by those that are so notoriously difficult to please is so fitting, for he was liked, trusted and respected by everyone.

Lieutenant Dalzell was killed on his birthday doing a job he loved and commanding a Platoon of which he was hugely fond and to which he was utterly committed. His colleagues have lost the most remarkable and inspiring officer.

Those who worked most closely with him say he was undoubtedly destined for great things in the Army; he just had the aura of a success story. However behind this brilliance was the most charming, polite and charismatic young man who was loved by all.

He joined the RAF on 10 August 2008 as a Gunner in the Royal Air Force Regiment and quickly proved his potential during basic training at Royal Air Force Honington.

He was identified early as one to watch owing to his natural soldiering ability and leadership potential that earned him the Frank Sylvester Trophy for Top Student on his Trainee Gunners Course.

On completing training he applied for parachute duties and was subsequently selected to serve with Number II Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment where he promptly qualified as a Direct Fire Weapons Specialist on Machine Gun Flight. He was attached to D Flight for his tour of duty in Afghanistan and deployed in January 2010.

SAC Southgate was immensely proud to be a member of the Royal Air Force Regiment and even more so to be a machine gun specialist. A reserved character, he was an extremely fit and strong Gunner who was described as 'happy, compassionate and fiercely loyal to his friends, who consider themselves lucky to have known him'. He used his strengths for the good of the team in the selfless style in which he led his life.

SAC Southgate intended to remain with II Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment for another two years before volunteering for a new challenge with UK Special Forces. However, his more immediate priority was to move in with his beloved girlfriend Caley of whom he openly spoke with loving affection.

The heart-felt thoughts and prayers of his squadron and regiment are with SAC Southgate's loved ones, particularly his parents and his girlfriend Caley whose tragic loss is shared far and wide by his fellow brothers-in-arms. The RAF Regiment has lost a friend and an exceptional Gunner who had a glittering future ahead of him.

A bricklayer before joining the Army, he excelled at the Infantry Training Centre, Catterick. He passed out of training in May 2007 and deployed to Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK 6 only three weeks later.

His age and maturity showed in Afghanistan and he was identified as a soldier with the potential to become a Junior Non-Commissioned Officer. He passed his Leadership Course in the winter of 2008 and was promoted shortly after.

His performance on this course was indicative of the man. In the swirling snow and sub-zero conditions and after four-and-a-half hours of tabbing up mountains he was still there, plugging away with a grim smile on his face. He soaked hardship up and got on with the job.

Private James Grigg was utterly loyal to The Regiment. He had only been in the Battalion just over a year when he deployed with 'The Vikings' to Afghanistan where he served in A (Norfolk) Company.

He attended Great Cornard Upper School before joining the Army Foundation College in 2001. 

After completing his training, he moved to Windsor and joined D Squadron, Household Cavalry Regiment, and deployed on Op FRESCO and on Op TELIC 1 as a driver in 2 Troop. These tours were followed shortly by Op HERRICK 4 as a gunner for the 1Troop, Corporal of Horse. 

After returning home from HERRICK 4, he immediately moved across to B Squadron and started training to deploy again to Iraq on TELIC 10 with the Brigade Reconnaissance Force. He completed Close Observation Training Advisory Course as a team commander and deployed in May 2007.

Recently Lance Corporal of Horse Woodgate completed a Formation Recce Crew Commanders' Course finishing in the top three of the course. 

Shortly after completing the course, Lance Corporal of Horse Woodgate went to Canada to take part in two MEDMAN exercises in the OPFOR Recce Company, to gain experience as a vehicle commander. On returning to Windsor he was sent to Command Troop for a few months before rejoining B Squadron shortly before Easter 2009 to prepare for Op HERRICK 11. 

He completed the Surveillance Reconnaissance Wing course as a Section Commander with a high pass, and also took part in the testing pre-deployment training needed to be part of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force.

Guardsman Michael Sweeney joined the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards after training at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick. He was posted to Number 2 Company in May 2008 for a short time before being posted to Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards based in London. 
In his short time in the Army Guardsman Sweeney achieved a huge amount. In June 2008 he paraded on the Queen's Birthday Parade followed by a jungle Exercise in Belize later that same year. With a short turnaround in the UK he soon deployed to Kenya in January 2009 for an extended exercise before returning to London to take part, once again, in the Queen's Birthday Parade. 
Surrounding his time in Number 7 Company was the knowledge that he would most likely deploy to Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK 11 and he therefore participated in elements of the Battalion's pre-deployment training. In December 2009 Guardsman Sweeney was posted back to the 1st Battalion and deployed to Helmand Province.
Guardsman Sweeney was posted to Number 2 Platoon in Number 1 Company, based in Patrol Base 4 in the Babaji Area of Operations. He deployed on the full range of complex combat operations. As well as conducting daily patrols he was involved in the security of Check Points near his Patrol Base.
Guardsman Sweeney aspired to join the Signal Platoon on return from this tour and then attend a Junior Non Commissioned Officer course. He was a young but very motivated Guardsman who thrived in the environs of Helmand Province. He was a highly likeable and respected member of a very close knit company.

He originally joined the Royal Navy on 19 May 1986, qualifying as a cook and serving at HMS Raleigh, HMS Cochrane and on board HMS Cleopatra.

He subsequently transferred to the Royal Marines, entering Recruit Training at the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines on 12 March 1990, passing for duty on 7 November 1990. During his 20 year career he served across the broad spectrum of Royal Marine Units including; Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines, 40 and 45 Commando Royal Marines and the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines as a Recruit Troop Instructor. 

He had a widespread background of instructional expertise in areas such as Mortars, Platoon Weapons and Jungle Warfare. He also had considerable operational experience in theatres such as Northern
Ireland, Southern Turkey and Northern Iraq and, most recently, Afghanistan. In 2005, he excelled in his Junior Command Training at the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines, placing in the top three
students on his course. 

This much deserved promotion gave him the opportunity to pass on his wealth of knowledge and experience to his young marines, something for which he felt extremely passionate about.

Joining 40 Commando Royal Marines in July 2009, he immediately conducted Mission Specific Training for deployment to Afghanistan. 

In April 2010, he deployed with Alpha Company, 40 Commando to Op HERRICK 12, employed as a Section Commander based out of Patrol Base ALMAS.

A former British Army soldier, he joined the Royal Marines on 26 April 2004. After passing for duty as a Royal Marines Commando he joined 45 Commando, based in Arbroath, Scotland.

During his first draft he took the opportunity to serve with Naval Party Iraq as part of the Operation TELIC Force Protection Team before returning to 45 Commando in January 2007. 

A second draft saw him remain in Scotland while he served with the Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines until January 2009. On completion of this draft he specialised within the anti-tank branch, qualifying as a Heavy Weapons (Class 3) Marine. Returning to 45 Commando he subsequently deployed on Operation HERRICK 9, serving in Kajaki with Victor Company.

From 45 Commando he joined Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, in November 2009, and immediately began Mission Specific Training for Operation HERRICK 12. Quickly promoting to Lance Corporal he deployed to Sangin, Afghanistan, in March 2010, where he was based. Charlie Company has been responsible for the security around the Sangin area and has conducted dozens of patrols in support of the local nationals. 

Having completed numerous joint clearance operations with Afghan National Security Forces and uncovered many improvised explosive devices, the area has increased freedom of movement and security so that the local population are able to go about their normal daily business.

During the early afternoon of Tuesday 22 June 2010, his patrol base was engaged by accurate small arms fire.

He was born in Wigan, and it was there that he lived with his partner Kate and their two young sons Ryan and Callum. 

He was a great fan of sports, particularly football and golf, but especially rugby: earlier in his career he represented the Corps as a rugby league player.

Joining the Royal Marines in 1996, he was drafted to 40 Commando Royal Marines on completion of his commando training. 

This first draft saw him serve an operational tour in Northern Ireland before choosing to specialise in the Heavy Weapons (Air Defence) branch. 

Serving with Air Defence Troop he deployed to Iraq in 2002 on Operation TELIC. He was selected for promotion, passing his Junior Command Course in 2003 and subsequently promoted to corporal. 

In 2007 he deployed to Afghanistan with 45 Commando on Operation HERRICK 5. As an experienced corporal, a senior command course quickly followed his tour of Afghanistan and he was promoted to sergeant in 2008. 

Rejoining 40 Commando in September 2009 he was initially employed as the Provost Sergeant, before becoming a Rifle Troop Sergeant within Alpha Company. Completing mission specific training for a further operational tour to Afghanistan, he deployed in April 2010 to Sangin with Alpha Company, where he was based at Patrol Base ALMAS. 

Alpha Company has conducted daily reassurance and security patrols with Afghan National Security Forces to protect the local Afghans around Patrol Base ALMAS in the Sangin District. 

They have improved the lives of hundreds of ordinary Afghans by providing a security bubble which has increased their freedom of movement, led to wider governance in the area and has encouraged economic development 

During a joint patrol with the Afghan National Army, on the morning of 23 June, Alpha Company was conducting a reassurance patrol to the local nationals in Sangin. At approximately 0734 hours local, as the patrol was returning to Patrol Base ALMAS, they came under small arms fire attack from insurgent forces.

He was blessed with the innate ability to brighten the darkest room; he also possessed a disarming sense of humour. Measured and thoughtful, his strength came from a depth of experience and knowledge that he was keen to share with others.

Armed with a positive 'can do' approach to every task, he was a trusted friend and colleague. A team member he most certainly was, but it was as an individual that his true colours were best displayed. Never one to follow the well-trodden path, he was confident in his own abilities and was always looking for new challenges.

Above all else Corporal Stephens was a doting husband and father. His absolute dedication and unfailing love for his family was abundantly clear for everybody to see. He could always be relied upon to be there for his family and friends, whose needs he always placed before his own.

He passed out for duty as a Royal Marines Commando on 16 October 2009, when he was awarded The Commando Medal.

The Commando Medal is awarded to the man who, throughout training, shows, to an outstanding degree, the qualities of the Commando Spirit. These are defined as: Determination, Courage, Cheerfulness and Unselfishness.

On completion of recruit training he was drafted to 40 Commando Royal Marines, based in Norton Fitzwarren, near Taunton.

Joining Charlie Company in October 2009 he immediately conducted Mission Specific Training for an operational tour with 40 Commando in Afghanistan. Qualifying as a combat medic, and singled out as an impressive and mature individual, he was quickly selected to become part of the newly formed Police Mentoring Team.

He started his career in the British Army as a rifle platoon commander in B Company 1st Battalion The Light Infantry having commissioned from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1999. 

As a rifle platoon commander he deployed to Northern Ireland as part of the Rural Reinforcement Battalion. 

In Northern Ireland he operated from an isolated patrol base and for his outstanding performance throughout this tour he was awarded a General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland commendation. 

Following rifle platoon command he was posted as an instructor to the 3rd Battalion Infantry Training Centre in Catterick. 

He then returned to regimental duty in Paderborn, Germany, in the Armoured Infantry role as the Second in Command of D Company 1 Light Infantry. 

He deployed on Op TELIC 3 to Maysan Province, Iraq, before then taking command of the Mortar Platoon. 

It was following his Mortar Platoon appointment that Major Bowman began to broaden his horizons with numerous overseas postings. 

From August 2005 he completed a year in International Military Advisory Training Team (Freetown) Sierra Leone as the Operations Training Officer / Battalion Operations Advisor. 

In September 2006 he returned to the UK as an SO3 instructor in the Junior Officer Tactics Division to the Land Warfare Centre in Warminster. 

On completion of his two year appointment he had been selected for promotion to Major. 

Prior to attendance on the Intermediate Command and Staff Course (Land) he squeezed in a 5 month tour as the Assistant Chief Instructor at the Iraqi Military Academy Ar Rustamiyah (IMAR). 

This was an 8 man training team supporting 600 Officer Cadets and 300 Iraqi Staff.

Major Bowman began his company command with 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles in May 2009 immediately after ICSC(L), swapping the lecture halls of Shrivenham for the heat and humidity of Brunei. 

In August 2009 the Battalion conducted the Unit Move from Brunei to the UK and began the pre-deployment training for the Op HERRICK 12 deployment. 

His Gurkha soldiers developed a natural respect and affection for a leader who balanced the best traditions of a rifle regiment soldier with humanity and hospitality that found him at home in A (Delhi) Company.

Major Bowman had led his company through some of the toughest fighting experienced by the Battlegroup on Op HERRICK 12 thus far. 

He balanced the softer side of population centric counter insurgency with a genuine ability to motivate and lead his company onto the offensive when required. 

But above all, he was a gentle and thoroughly good man, who often spoke of his family and his girlfriend, Lucy. Our thoughts and prayers are with them all during these tragic times.",7/13/10 12:43,7/14/10 21:316859,Turkington,Neal,,Lt.,Dead,M,26,Craigavon,Northern Ireland,Britain,Britain,,,"1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, serving as part of Combined Force Nahr-e Saraj (South)",,,,7/13/10 0:00,7/13/10 0:00,Action,southern Afghanistan,MoD: Killed in a suspected premeditated attack by a member of the Afghan National Army.,"MoD: After graduating from Imperial College London he attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst from 2007. 

He commissioned into 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles in August 2008 and went on to successfully complete the Platoon Commanders' Battle Course in Brecon, South Wales. 

His first appointment at regimental duty took him to the jungles of Brunei where he quickly settled in at the helm of 2 Platoon within A (Delhi) Company.

Having settled in to regimental life in Brunei, Lieutenant Turkington continued his Gurkha education by attending the mandatory three months of language study in Pokhara, Western Nepal. 

A keen adventurer and traveller he found many similarities between the foothills of the Himalaya and the other parts of the world which he travelled to so frequently, notably South America. 

At the end of the language training he conducted a memorable trek through Nepal in support of the Gurkha Welfare Trust and perfected the art of speaking Nepali with an Irish accent.

On returning to Brunei Lieutenant Turkington turned his attention back to a profession that he showed a real zeal for. The demanding jungle of Brunei was the perfect environment for this passionate infanteer. 

He had the highest expectations of himself and his platoon, to whom he dedicated himself wholeheartedly. 

Lieutenant Turkington relished the intellectual challenges of infantry command as much as the physical. 

Ambitious for his platoon, he was constantly challenging accepted practices in order to improve himself and his team, a trait that bore real fruits in the initial three months in Afghanistan.

Lieutenant Turkington was in his element as a junior commander and leader in Afghanistan. 

The time and effort that he had dedicated to his soldiers over the previous two years was paying dividends every day in the toughest of environments. 

Under his command 2 Platoon had been playing a key role in the complex counter insurgency campaign that A (Delhi) Company are engaged in. 

He understood it and he ensured that each of his soldiers did too. 

In the early stages of this operational tour he had shown himself to be a decisive leader with a strong will, the boys followed him and would do so again and again through the most testing of situations.

Outside of his military life Neal had dedicated so much time to other people, he was a humanitarian at heart, except in the boxing ring, and this was shown through a charity that he and friends had established in South America. 

Both in and out of work he was a professional of the highest standards, a leader of his generation.

His career was varied and successful and he was a hugely popular soldier wherever he served. 

In 1998-99 he was a member of the Gurkha Reinforcement Company attached to B Company, 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales‰Ûª Royal Regiment. 

Most recently, he was posted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst where he supported the training of future Officers for the British Army and other national forces.

Cpl Arjun was in 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles based in Brunei at the time when they deployed on Op HERRICK 7 as the Reserve Battlegroup as part of Regional Command South based in Kandahar. 

He deployed on Op HERRICK 12 in early June 2010 as a battlefield casualty replacement. 

He brought with him a wealth of experience which quickly became highly valued by the chain of command. 

Soon after his arrival, his Company Commander Major Bowman, who was also tragically killed in the same incident, commented on Corporal Arjun‰Ûªs excellent attitude and approach. 

This is exactly what was expected from him as a Junior Non Commissioned Officer who had been awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal in January 2010, his first possible look at such an award.

Corporal Arjun was a soldier who excelled and thrived on new challenges and the list of courses that he attended and completed is extensive. 

He completed the Section Commanders‰Ûª Battle Course in Brecon, South Wales in October 2002 and was promoted to substantive Corporal in June 2003. 

He was an instructor and advisor in mine awareness and Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defence, a testament to his pioneering background.

His selfless approach and professionalism is reflected in the way in which he arrived in Afghanistan to replace an injured comrade. 

The Company had suffered losses before and Corporal Arjun was exactly the sort of individual that this Battalion wanted to see arrive to fill a gap. 

He was an outstanding member of the Royal Gurkha Rifles, a credit to Nepal and himself; he shall never be forgotten. 

He leaves behind his wife and two children and will truly be missed by his family in Nepal and the UK.",7/13/10 12:52,7/14/10 21:406861,Garvin,Nathaniel D.,,Spc.,Dead,M,20,Radcliff,Ky.,U.S. ,U.S.,Army,Active duty,"96th Aviation Support Battalion, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)",Fort Campbell,Ky.,,7/12/10 0:00,7/12/10 0:00,Non-combat,"Forward Operating Base Frontenac, Afghanistan (Kandahar, Afghanistan)","DoD: Died July 12 at Forward Operating Base Frontenac, Afghanistan (Kandahar, Afghanistan), of injuries sustained from a non-combat related incident.",,7/13/10 19:20,7/15/10 21:526862,Mittler,Shaun M.,,Staff Sgt.,Dead,M,32,Austin,Texas,U.S. ,U.S.,Army,Active,"1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)",Fort Campbell,Ky.,,7/10/10 0:00,7/10/10 0:00,Action,"Kunar, Afghanistan","DoD: Died July 10 in Kunar, Afghanistan, of injuries sustained when enemy forces attacked his unit using rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fires",,7/14/10 11:07,7/15/10 21:566863,Goeke,Christopher S.,,1st Lt.,Dead,M,23,Apple Valley,Minn.,U.S. ,U.S.,Army,Active duty,"1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division",Fort Bragg,N.C.,,7/13/10 0:00,7/13/10 0:00,Action,"Kandahar City, Afghanistan","DoD: Three soldiers died July 13 in Kandahar City, Afghanistan, of wounds sustained when insurgents attacked their unit with rifle, rocket propelled grenade, and small arms fire.",,7/14/10 11:09,7/19/10 13:556864,Stanley,Chase,,Spc.,Dead,M,21,Napa,Calif.,U.S. ,U.S.,Army,Active duty,"27th Engineer Battalion (Combat Airborne), 20th Engineer Brigade (Combat)",Fort Bragg,N.C.,,7/14/10 0:00,7/14/10 0:00,Action,"Zabul Province, Afghanistan","Dod: Died July 14 at Zabul Province, Afghanistan, of wounds sustained when insurgents attacked their military vehicle with an improvised explosive device.",,7/14/10 11:13,8/4/10 11:006865,Stout,Christopher T.,,Staff Sgt.,Dead,M,34,Worthville,Ky.,U.S. ,U.S.,Army,Active duty,"1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division",Fort Bragg,N.C.,,7/13/10 0:00,7/13/10 0:00,Action,"Kandahar City, Afghanistan","DoD: Three soldiers died July 13 in Kandahar City, Afghanistan, of wounds sustained when insurgents attacked their unit with rifle, rocket propelled grenade, and small arms fire.",,7/14/10 11:14,7/16/10 18:346866,Johnson,Matthew J.,,Spc.,Dead,M,21,Maplewood,Minn.,U.S. ,U.S.,Army,Active duty,"27th Engineer Battalion (Combat Airborne), 20th Engineer Brigade (Combat)",Fort Bragg,N.C.,,7/14/10 0:00,7/14/10 0:00,Action,"Zabul Province, Afghanistan","DoD: Died July 14 at Zabul Province, Afghanistan, of wounds sustained when insurgents attacked their military vehicle with an improvised explosive device.

After completing the Combat Infantryman's Course at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick he joined 1st Battalion The King's Own Scottish Borderers before the formation of The Royal Regiment of Scotland in March 2006.

He accrued a raft of operational experience during his time in the Army, completing tours of Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan; often selected for demanding specialist roles on operations on the basis of his enthusiasm and natural talent for his chosen profession. Equally charismatic in barracks as he was in the field, he prided himself on his position as a battalion Physical Training Instructor.

Lance Corporal Pool died doing a job he loved surrounded by men proud to call him a friend. He will be sorely missed by all his colleagues in both 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Brigade Reconnaissance Force.

His dedication to his comrades on the battlefield was only surpassed by that to his family; his fiancÌ©e Lynsey and sons Lee and Jamie were never far from his thoughts. He also leaves behind his mother and father, Stella and Roddy, and brother Ryan.

He attended Queen Elizabeth's School in Wimborne, Dorset, before joining the Army in 2007. 

He completed basic training at the Army Training Regiment Bassingbourn before passing out of Royal Armoured Corps Phase 2 training at Bovington. He joined The Queen's Royal Lancers in Catterick, North Yorkshire, in February of 2008, and in doing so became the third generation of his family to serve with the regiment. 

Trooper Howarth has spent the duration of his career in C Squadron as a reconnaissance vehicle driver. He was exceptionally gifted at maintaining and managing the armoured vehicles under his stewardship and was chosen from amongst his peers to drive for his troop leader. 

He showed his true abilities from the start, driving for his troop leader on training exercises on Salisbury Plain Training Area, during Exercise Medicine Man in British Army Training Unit Suffield in the summer of 2009, throughout Mission Specific Training for Op HERRICK 12, and during deployment in Afghanistan from April 2010. 

His initiative, self-motivation and robustness, both physical and mental, were exceptional in a soldier of such youth and inexperience; he would have, without doubt, risen through the ranks above and beyond his peers. He had an infectious smile and a truly inspirational sense of humour. 

Aside from his life as a professional formation reconnaissance soldier, Trooper Howarth was an immensely charismatic young sportsman. He had a deep-rooted love of rugby football and represented the regimental side on many occasions. He was also an avid alpine skier, having learnt to ski with the regimental alpine ski team in Verbier, Switzerland, in 2008; although he was only a beginner, his enthusiasm, absolute courage and determination easily compensated for his lack of experience on the slopes. 

Trooper Howarth was killed in action during a vehicle patrol in the Bolan district of Lashkar Gah on 18 September 2010 alongside one of his colleagues. He was serving as part of Fondouk Squadron, The Queen's Royal Lancers, and was providing security to the people of Helmand province during a vehicle-mounted ground domination patrol by denying insurgents' freedom of movement. He leaves behind his parents, John and Sarah, and his older brother Marcus.

He completed basic training at the Army Training Regiment Bassingbourn in February of 1998, before passing out of the Royal Engineers Combat Engineering Course in August of the same year.
 
He deployed to Kosovo with 31 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 32 Engineer Regiment, before being posted to the Royal Engineers Armoured Trials and Development Unit in Bovington Camp, Dorset. After this Sergeant Jones was posted to D Squadron, The Queen's Royal Lancers, as an Engineer Reconnaissance Troop Sergeant in February 2009. 

His service with D Squadron saw him conducting demolition on ranges in Scotland, leading a team over the Yorkshire Three Peaks in 24 hours and overseeing the site reconnaissance and placing of bridges for The Queen's Royal Lancers Battle Group in British Army Training Unit Suffield, Canada, in 2009. 

For his deployment to Afghanistan earlier this year he was placed in 1st Troop, Fondouk Squadron, The Queen's Royal Lancers, and immediately made a name for himself as a tirelessly efficient, sharp-witted and boundlessly enthusiastic individual; his performance on Operation HERRICK 12 was second-to-none.

Sergeant Jones was quick to fit into regimental life in Catterick; his sense of humour and dulcet Welsh accent made him popular with the troops and in the Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess. An avid supporter of the Welsh rugby team, he was never more at home than when arguing over a referee's decision in a test match against England.

Above all, Sergeant Jones was a family man. He spoke endlessly of his wife Joanne, and children, Natasha, Caitlin and Liam, and of his plans for the future. While his professional focus was unquestioned, his heart remained with his family for the duration of his tour in Afghanistan.

He passed the notoriously gruelling process for Gurkha selection into the British Army in December 2007; becoming the first member of his family to achieve this feat.

In early January 2008 he made the journey from the tranquil foothills of the Nepalese Himalaya to Catterick in North Yorkshire as a trainee Rifleman ready to begin the arduous months of Gurkha infantry training.

In October 2008 he completed this training and travelled to Brunei to join 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles. As a result of his good command of English and his obvious intelligence he was immediately selected to be the platoon radio operator. This position is normally reserved for a senior Rifleman and as such it was testament to the high regard in which he was held so early on in his career.

Rifleman Suraj returned to the United Kingdom in August 2009 and was selected as the lead man in his patrol, known as the vallon man, for the upcoming tour to Afghanistan. His ability had again been singled out.

He deployed on Op HERRICK 12 in April 2010 and even from the start of the tour he was always confident and calm under pressure. As a soldier he excelled in Afghanistan; as the point man of every patrol he led his multiple unflinchingly across some of the most daunting and uncertain terrain, day after day, time after time.

For six months he had been finding IEDs and selecting safe routes, keeping those following behind safe.

Only recently married he leaves behind his wife and family in Nepal.
